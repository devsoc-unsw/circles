Communities all around the world are subject to policies and projects that seek to change their lives for the better. Some succeed, some do not. Some are designed locally, some are designed much further away. Some are the result of shared ideas about what makes human life better while others are challenges to the way things are and call for dramatic changes to society. Other major changes come about through external factors: the coronavirus pandemic, conflict and forced migration, climate change and extreme weather events, amongst others. In this course we explore what drives development interventions, their impacts on communities, and the ways they respond. We explore also the processes and influences that operate at a global level and that impact such fundamental concerns as human rights, population health, environmental and climate change, and migration.\n\nThrough a series of nine key topic areas that form the content of the course, you will learn why development thinking \u2013 and by extension development practice \u2013 has changed over time, and the extent to which its architects have learned from past failure and successes.

The course then turns to fundamental cultural commonalities centring on statecraft, institutions, education and notions of civilization that united and divided the region. Cross cultural comparisons among China, Japan, and Korea highlight the global and regional dimensions of cultural change in East Asia. These frame cultural similarities and differences that influenced the varying approaches to modernity taken by Chinese, Japanese and Korean activists when East Asia came under increasing pressure from the West.

On the other hand, dealing with climate change and extinction have challenged the way that media and communications work. The mainstream media has had to change its approach to what counts as news, and to the way it sets agendas. Journalists have had to grapple with complex science in new ways.

These include critiques of essentialism in traditional perceptions of cultural/individual identity, which in Queer Theory today extends to a critique of conventional (for e.g. gay and lesbian) identity politics.\n", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Humanities and Languages", "faculty": "Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {}, "exclusions": {}, "path_to": {}, "terms": [""], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "ARTS3901": {"title": "Race and Gender", "code": "ARTS3901", "UOC": 6, "level": 3, "description": "We often understand knowledge as a neutral, disinterested point of view: as purely rational, untainted by partiality or prejudice, and detached from the social and political entanglements that cloud objectivity.

Along the way, you will also learn how humans convert foods into useful energy, what exactly is happening in your bodies during weight loss and weight gain, and by the end you will be able to critically examine popular weight loss claims as well as your own diet and lifestyle.

A particular emphasis is placed on using online tutorials and computer labs to apply engineering principles for the design of a biological system, followed by wet labs to build and evaluate the biological function of the assemblages.\u00a0This design - build - test paradigm reinforces an understanding of how biological systems are not static processes to be memorised, but rather, dynamic systems which can be manipulated and built from the ground-up.\n\n\u00a0\n", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences", "faculty": "Faculty of Science", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {}, "exclusions": {}, "path_to": {}, "terms": ["T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {"BIOC2201": 1}}, "BABS3281": {"title": "Molecular Frontiers", "code": "BABS3281", "UOC": 6, "level": 3, "description": "This course focuses on molecular biology techniques commonly used in biomedical research.

Understanding the art of evidence based science communication has become more important than ever before in a world where fake science news threatens our ability to communicate science effectively. \nFor those students going on to a higher degree in science, a basic requirement of being a successful scientist is to be able to effectively communicate. However, very few scientists have had any formal evidence-based science communication education. Fewer still have been taught how new emerging communication technologies can engage audiences with science or how to use emotion and be personable when communicating science. This course prepares students for a career in their chosen science discipline.\nThe objective of BEES6800 is to help students to gain confidence in clearly communicating science and why it matters across multiple peer and public audiences in multiple modes, and via multiple digital technologies and media \u2013 including social media.\nThe course is fully online.\nAssessment will be through three connected online assignments that directly address course outcomes.These outcomes include understanding the nature and processes of science, being able to communicate science clearly with multiple audiences in multiple modes, understanding the best use of new and emerging technologies to communicate science, thinking critically and creatively, and knowing how to measure the effectiveness of science communication.\nThere is no final exam.\nStudents need 48 Units of Credit to take this science elective course. There is no assumed knowledge of science communication.\nStudents taking this course will be able to communicate effectively as scientists, and may find it useful if considering a career in science communication.\n\u00a0", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences", "faculty": "Faculty of Science", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {}, "exclusions": {}, "path_to": {"BEES2680": 1}, "terms": ["T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "BEIL0001": {"title": "Graphic Design for the Built Environment", "code": "BEIL0001", "UOC": 6, "level": 0, "description": "This elective is open to students in the Architecture, Interior Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Industrial Design, Computational Design, Construction Management and Planning disciplines.

Heuristics do not guarantee to compute optimal solutions but tend to work well in practice. Approximation algorithms give additional guarantees of the quality of computed solution as compared to the optimal solution.\n\nAmong algorithms that only solve a subset of instances, we discuss graph classes where NP-hard graph problems often become polynomial-time solvable when the input is restricted to these classes.\n\nAmong algorithms that do not run in polynomial time, we discuss exponential-time algorithms and parameterized algorithms. In exponential-time algorithms we discuss algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case. In parameterized algorithms, a parameter k is associated with each instance and the goal is to design algorithms whose worst-case running time is fast whenever k is small.

Specific areas of focus include: why some activities are criminalised and others not; the use and misuse of discretion; the impact of the reliance on summary justice; the significance of pre-trial processes such as search, arrest and bail; and the over-representation of Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.Crime and the Criminal Process also introduces the doctrinal building blocks of criminal law, and applies these principles to a number of key statutory offences such as public order offences and drugs offences which illustrate the process themes above.

It complements, and is studied in the same session as, LAWS1124 - Lawyers and Society.\n\u00a0\nCFLS develops students\u2019 understanding of the functioning of the legal system and facility with foundational legal skills that students acquired in LAWS1121 \u2013 Legal System and Skills A. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts and legal paradigms in three core areas of substantive law: contract; tort and criminal law. The course focuses on students\u2019 acquisition of legal problem-solving skills in both oral and written contexts to enhance students\u2019 understanding of legal principles found in case and statute law in these three fields. It provides preparation for, and an introduction to, the study of Contract, Tort and Criminal Law in the LLB program.\n\u00a0\nModule 1: Contract\nA good grounding in the basic principles of contract law is a fundamental element of any legal education. This Module is an introduction to the study of voluntarily assumed legal obligations which govern many important areas of daily life. This Module focuses on students acquiring a sound understanding of a number of basic principles of contract law, through common law method, with particular focus on the elements required for the formation of a valid contract, namely offer and acceptance; consideration; intention to create legal relations; certainty and privity.\n\u00a0\nModule 2: Criminal Justice\nThe aims of the Criminal Justice module are to introduce students to foundational elements of the criminal law, and some key issues related to criminal justice. The course will include an examination of the components of criminal offences generally, and will take two substantive offences (murder and offensive language/behaviour) to see how these elements play out in practice.\n\u00a0\nModule 3: Tort\nThis module covers the part of the law of torts which signifies, broadly speaking, the law determining liability to pay compensation for wrongfully caused injury, damage or loss through medical negligence.\nThe prime objective is to introduce students to the core principles of negligence, including a critical understanding of the policy considerations informing the law. A second objective of this course is to examine a relatively limited number of leading cases and legislation in selected areas and thereby develop skills of analysis, synthesis and evaluation. A third objective is to encourage students to consider the way in which the law of torts operates in the context of society as a whole, and the ways in which it is influenced by such particular factors as insurance, social security, and the need (or absence of a need) to ascribe fault. Thus there is a theoretical component to the course which introduces various debates about the nature and effectiveness of tort law.\u00a0 ", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Global and Public Law", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {}, "exclusions": {}, "path_to": {}, "terms": ["T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "LAWS1124": {"title": "Lawyers and Society", "code": "LAWS1124", "UOC": 6, "level": 1, "description": "\nThe KLC component of Lawyers and Society fits with your other law courses in that it demonstrates law in practice and the specific ways in which it impacts on disadvantaged clients.

Students will acquire an understanding of the introductory principles and theories of administrative and constitutional law as they apply to the essential features of the Australian system of government, and their implications for human rights and the rule of law. The course exposes students to this material through an examination of Australia\u2019s hybrid constitutional inheritance from the United Kingdom and United States, as adapted in the creation and subsequent development of the federal Commonwealth. In doing so it also examines the implications of colonisation for Indigenous legal systems and assertions of Crown sovereignty. The role, powers and interrelationship of the three arms of government are considered in contemporary as well as historical context, as are the issues of rights protection and constitutional change. The course prepares students for their later study of the courses LAWS1160: Administrative Law and LAWS2150: Federal Constitutional Law, and also introduces students to the fundamentals of the skill of statutory interpretation in the public law context.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMain Topics\nConstitutionalismRights Protection and Australian ConstitutionalismConstitutional ChangeAustralia\u2019s \u2018Washminster\u2019 Inheritance\nThe Westminster TraditionThe American Tradition\nThe Creation of the Federated Commonwealth of Australia\nColonisation, Indigenous Sovereignty and Crown SovereigntyThe Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and the Path to FederationThe Acquisition of Legal Independence and Popular Sovereignty\nThe Legislature\nHistory and DevelopmentThe Franchise and the Composition of ParliamentLegislative PowerJudicial Review of LegislationStatutory InterpretationState Constitutions and State Legislative Power\u00a0\nThe Executive\nHistory and DevelopmentFederal and State Executive PowerJudicial Review of Executive ActionNon-Judicial Forms of Executive Accountability\nThe Judiciary\nHistory, Development and CompositionA Foundation of Judicial Independence\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Global and Public Law", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {"JURD7140": 1}, "exclusions": {"JURD7140": 1, "JURD7141": 1, "LAWS1140": 1}, "path_to": {"LAWS1160": 1, "LAWS2150": 1}, "terms": ["T2", "T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {"LAWS1052": 1}}, "LAWS1150": {"title": "Principles of Private Law", "code": "LAWS1150", "UOC": 6, "level": 1, "description": "LAWS1150\u00a0is only available in T1 by School Consent.

In both cases, the course provides an introduction to materials that are expanded upon in later subjects. With respect to contract law, this course covers the formation of contracts and the doctrine of privity. Several other elements of contract law are dealt with later in the curriculum in Contracts. With respect to property law, this course considers the boundaries of the concept of property, as well as several of the rules with respect to the creation, transfer and protection of property rights. Again several other elements of property law are dealt with later in Land Law, and to some extent also in Equity and Trusts.\nThe course also introduces students to two smaller topics: agency and equitable estoppel.

These contexts include the history and workings of the legal profession and its rapidly changing circumstances. They also include the diverse and demanding environments in which contemporary lawyers work. \nThis course treats questions of ethics as found in everyday decisions and behaviour, general as well as those particular to lawyers. However, Lawyers, Ethics &amp; Justice addresses, in particular, the responsibilities of lawyers in maintaining the integrity of the justice system. In doing so, students will analyse the roles lawyers do and should play in the justice system, and relate them to the values and routine skills lawyers have, or should have, to ensure effective and just outcomes. \nThe course is also designed for students to evaluate the conduct of lawyers, the nature of ethical practice, and the pursuit of justice in light of their own identities, values and skills. Students are asked to consider what acting in accordance their values would mean for their own professional lives. \nDuring the course, students will start to develop the skills they will need to engage in ethical legal practice, including those to: identify and address ethics issues; work with colleagues and other professionals to institute and maintain ethical work practices; recognise and manage the diverse needs and interests of clients; and integrate often competing duties to clients, the workplace, the profession, the judicial system and society.

Why do we do these things? Is it because we want to do the \u201cright\u201d thing? Or simply because it is the law? Put differently: why do humans need and create laws and what do we aim to accomplish through law?\n\nWithin the Western tradition, law often reflects religious values (for example, those of the Ten Commandments) while Roman Law established the first sophisticated \u201crule of law\u201d. From the authoritarian commands of Kings, Queens or dictators to the promise of \u201csocial contracts\u201d and modern deliberative democracy, law has developed into a highly complex tool to organize the way we live together. It is now perceived as safe-guarding our freedom and equality, as solidifying the power of economic and political elites, empowering minorities to fight racism and discrimination, a tool to control property and territory, and organize global flows of people and products. Law is, most importantly, also our main instrument to overcome violence and injustice, punish, settle conflicts and create reconciliation.\n\nThe course examines all these aspects in a historical, analytical and critical manner by showcasing different legal-philosophical positions, mainly taken from the Western jurisprudential canon while also looking at Indigenous and Asian perspectives. Some of the theories we engage with are: Natural Law, Legal Positivism, Legal Hermeneutics, Legal Realism, Feminist Jurisprudence, Legal Pluralism, Legal Pragmatism. In addition, the course engages with the wider framework of law: moral and political philosophy. \u00a0\n\nIn sum, Legal Theory reflects on fundamental problems of modern law from a legal, moral and political perspective and provides students with a deeper understanding of the presuppositions that inform law, legal institutions and their own future professional practices.

We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law.\nNot only will the course analyse different theories of justice, but it will also put the ideas, gained through such analysis, to work by considering a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?\nMain Topics\nIntroduction the problem of Law and Justice via an examination of Plato\u2019s RepublicAristotle\u2019s theory of justice and its legacy (corrective and distributive justice; questions of justice requiring good judgment)From theories of law and justice conceived in terms of natural law to natural rights and social contract theory (Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke and Kant and Rawls)Non-contractualist theories of law and justice: Hume, the Utilitarians and particularly HegelLegal justice and justice as interpretation; Dworkin, and GadamerMarx\u2019s critique of all prevailing conceptions of legal rights, the rule of law and justiceJustice in a pluralist society; the just (secular) state; the just multicultural state and Global justiceThe contemporary Frankfurt School\u2019s theories of law and justice in terms of theories of discourse and recognition.Feminism, the ethic or care and the critique of legal justiceThe post-structuralist deconstruction of law and justice", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Law, Society and Criminology", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {"JURD7336": 1, "JURD7236": 1, "LAWS3326": 1}, "exclusions": {"LAWS2820": 1, "LAWS2384": 1, "LAWS2320": 1}, "path_to": {"LAWS3017": 1}, "terms": ["T2", "T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "LAWS2351": {"title": "Court Process, Evidence and Proof", "code": "LAWS2351", "UOC": 6, "level": 2, "description": "LAWS2351 is only available in T1 by School Consent.

These topics are examined in their legal, ethical and socio-psychological dimensions. The course approaches these topics by first exploring the legal and factual elements that define evidence law. In the criminal context, the course additionally explores prosecutors\u2019 ethical and legal obligations to the court and to the defendant. From this preliminary framework students examine key principles, rules and institutional elements associated with the formal adjudication of legal disputes. Australia\u2019s uniform evidence legislation provides the major doctrinal focus of this course. Its institutional focus centres on the role of participants in the court process. The course aims to foster in students critical analytical skills and values consistent with aspirational ideals of professional and ethical legal practice. These goals are pursued by observational fieldwork, audiovisual aids, occasional guest speakers, readings and the engagement of students in classroom discussion that is aimed at developing their understanding of the complexities and challenges evidence law and court processes create for litigants, lawyers, witnesses and decisionmakers.

The course addresses civil procedure which governs the steps involved in initiating, conducting, managing, terminating, enforcing or appealing the outcome of, legal proceedings in a Court. Specific attention is paid to jurisdiction, case management, pleadings, discovery and costs. The course provides an introduction to Alternative Dispute Resolution, in particular, negotiation, mediation and arbitration. The course examines the advantages and disadvantages of each dispute resolution procedure and the factors that influence when they should be utilised from both policy and practice perspectives.

It traces the historical development of equity and its relationship with common law. Students will critically consider the appropriate application of a range of equitable doctrines to particular scenarios and the availability of different remedies. Students will also be introduced to the law of trusts and, in particular, the nature of a trust, legal requirements in establishing a trust as well as the rights, duties and powers associated with trusts. The course assumes familiarity with equitable doctrines taught in Principles of Private Law and Contracts, for instance estoppel, undue influence, unconscionability. This is an important pre-requisite for learning about trusts, which involve property.This course is one of the core subjects for law and will normally be taken after completion of Contracts. It fits within the private law stream, which includes such subjects as Torts, Contracts and Land Law. It provides a good grounding for further studies in this area.\nMain Topics\nThe aim of the course is to ensure that you are familiar with the central principles of equity, including the law of trusts.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society.\u00a0 Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them. Theoretical investigation looks beneath what we all too often take for granted, to see what accounts for it, how it works, and how it changes.\u00a0\n\nSocial theory is a particular way of asking theoretical questions, which tries to explain why things are as they are by examining the social practices and institutions that shape the way that people live.\u00a0 To study law and social theory is to explore theoretical issues that arise when we see law as one part of this broader social context.\u00a0\n\nSome of the questions that we address in the course include: what social functions are played by legal systems, and the modern legal system in particular? How does law intersect with other social systems, practices, and forms of power?\u00a0 How, for example, is the legal system influenced by the economy, and how does it shape the economy in turn?\u00a0 What is the relationship between the legal system and political actors, such as the state, bureaucracy, classes and social movements?\u00a0 How does law shape, and how is it influenced by, socially dominant ways of thinking, such as ideology, rationality, or beliefs about class, gender, and race?\u00a0 What drives change in the legal system?\u00a0 Is it, for example, the practices of lawyers, politicians, or social movements?\u00a0 Is it the evolution of ideas? Or economic imperatives?\u00a0\n\nWe will explore these questions in both an historical and contemporary context.\u00a0 We will examine the work of the foundational thinkers in the tradition of social theory, such as Karl Marx and Max Weber, who were responding to the massive social, economic, scientific and intellectual changes of the nineteenth century.\u00a0 Their work continues to provide insight into the relationship between law and society, because the contemporary world, has inherited many of the ideas and institutions that came to dominate society in their time, including the market economy, democracy, and liberal individualism.\u00a0 The course also engages with more contemporary theorists whose work responds to the changing social and legal landscape of the 20th and 21st centuries.\u00a0 This may include the work of Michel Foucault, systems theory, feminist criticism, or theories of biopolitics.\u00a0 We will draw on these thinkers, not only to reflect on the themes of the course, but to think about pressing issues, such as the impact of neoliberalism and globalisation on the law, the treatment of refugees, emergency politics and constitutional democracy, and the legal and political response to climate change.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStudying theories of law and society will hopefully lead us beyond our original, and usually quite unreflective views of what is important in law, what role it plays in society, whose interests it serves, what causes legal change, and how important law is. In probing these questions, we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.\n", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Law, Society and Criminology", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {"LAWS3332": 1, "JURD7632": 1, "JURD7222": 1}, "exclusions": {"LAWS2384": 1, "LAWS2326": 1, "LAWS2320": 1}, "path_to": {"LAWS3017": 1}, "terms": ["T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "LAWS3014": {"title": "Insolvency Law", "code": "LAWS3014", "UOC": 6, "level": 3, "description": "The course intends to provide an understanding of the law and practice relating to personal bankruptcy law and to corporate insolvency.

This multi-disciplinary course is an opportunity for law students to develop an understanding of the role played by law in cyber policy and operation, and then to work alongside future security engineers solving cyber security challenges. Law students will focus on the role of regulation, while engineering students (COMP6441/COMP6841 Security Engineering and Cyber Security) will cover more technical computing material, with all students coming together in tutorials to analyse policy and practical challenges. Law students are the \u2018legal experts\u2019 in interdisciplinary spaces, engaging with engineering students in collective problem-solving. Over the course of the Term, students will gain confidence in working collaboratively with engineers.\nThe course is not a typical law course in its structure or assessment. Law students attend a two hour lecture on the foundations of cyber security (with Engineering students), a two hour law seminar, and a two hour tutorial (with Engineering students) each week. While there are few readings (mostly statutes and policy documents, some cases), there are online law and engineering activities to complete each week. These sometimes take law students outside their comfort zone, encouraging &#34;security thinking&#34; and an &#34;attacker mindset.&#34; Students should expect to commit approximately 15 hours a week to the course including attendance, self-directed research, completion of on-line modules, preparation for tutorials and seminars, and completion of assessment.\nFoundational security topics to which law students are introduced include insiders, privacy, cybercrime, social engineering, risk, secrets, authentication, physical security, weakest link, supply chain, cognitive biases, organisational change, incident response, security analysis, open source intelligence and reconnaissance. These are introduced through case studies, focusing on recent developments. Legal topics include relevant aspects of tort law, contract law, consumer law, directors duties, privacy law, telecommunications regulation, critical infrastructure regulation, criminal law, national security and law enforcement powers, and international law. The focus is on Australian law, but comparative material is included where relevant. Other regulation (such as national policy and standards) are also discussed. The goal is understanding how the different strands of law apply to current policy problems in the field of cyber security, rather than being a comprehensive coverage of particular doctrinal domains covered elsewhere in the degree. Tutorials provide an interactive opportunity to tackle complex policy problems from a multi-disciplinary perspective.\nThe primary background needed is a keen, devious and analytical mind.

It is vital to the marketing, advertising, entertainment, communications and science and technology industries. The two courses together aim to introduce students to each of the general law and statutory protections outlined above. For each of the heads of protection, the courses gives detailed consideration to the subject matter which is protected, the pre-conditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Various justifications for IP are also considered, particularly in the context of new or developing forms of IP.\n\nIntellectual Property 1: Copyright and Designs considers two key aspects of Australian IP law. The first, which is the focus of the course, is the law of copyright. Copyright primarily protects creative and entrepreneurial subject matter such as books, art, music, films and TV broadcasts. The course focuses on key issues such as the history of and justifications for copyright; copyright subject matter; requirements for subsistence; ownership and exploitation; infringement, defences and remedies; and moral rights. Attention will also be paid to emerging debates, policy issues and law reform proposals on such issues as the impact of digital technology, rights in entertainment franchises and indigenous artists\u2019 rights. The second aspect of IP law considered in the course is registered designs, with a focus on requirements for registration, infringement, and the techniques used to manage the overlap between copyright and design protection.\n\nIntellectual\u00a0 Property 1 and Intellectual Property 2 can be taken in any order.\n\nPlease be aware that students who take Intellectual Property 1 and/or Intellectual Property 2 will not be able to take LAWS3021 Foundations of Intellectual Property Law and/or LAWS3057 Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice.

This is because, in comparison with civilian legal systems, Australia (1987) and England and Wales (1991) were both slow to recognise unjust enrichment as a source of rights and duties within the law of obligations. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s many unjust enrichment claims have been decided in Australia and England, resulting in significant divergences between the two jurisdictions. These divergences remain contentious and a source of debate between appellate courts and legal scholars.\n\nAt a high level of generality, a plaintiff in an unjust enrichment case must show that: (i) the defendant was enriched; (ii) the defendant\u2019s enrichment was gained at the plaintiff\u2019s expense; and (iii) the defendant\u2019s enrichment was unjust.

To analyse the impact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translated into the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale, while exploring its application to both novel and familiar scenarios arising from the ubiquity of digital technologies. It is the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter and analyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability of cyber criminals and their enablers; how the principles of personal information privacy can be adapted to a virtualised global setting; how emerging technologies can disrupt existing legal forms such as contracts or \u2018anonymous\u2019 data; and determining the appropriate models of liability and responsibility applicable to platforms based on eg, social media or AI.\nA statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: \u201c[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judges are to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles] that preserves [their] meaning from one world\u2019s technology to another.

It examines the following question: What does the concept &#34;biology&#34;\u00a0do\u00a0in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as &#34;nature&#34;, &#34;bodies&#34;, &#34;organism&#34;, &#34;groups&#34; or &#34;life&#34; (to name just a few). &#34;Law and Biology&#34; aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.\nThe unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similar to these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system.\u00a0\nStudents wishing to think about law \u201coutside the box&#34; and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course.

It begins by exploring the question \u201cwhat is justice\u201d? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?\nMain Topics\nIntroduction the problem of Law and Justice via an examination of Plato\u2019s RepublicAristotle\u2019s theory of justice and its legacy (corrective and distributive justice; questions of justice requiring good judgment)From theories of law and justice conceived in terms of natural law to natural rights and social contract theory (Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke and Kant and Rawls)Non-contractualist theories of law and justice: Hume, the Utilitarians and particularly HegelLegal justice and justice as interpretation; Dworkin, and GadamerMarx\u2019s critique of all prevailing conceptions of legal rights, the rule of law and justiceJustice in a pluralist society; the just (secular) state; the just multicultural state and Global justiceThe contemporary Frankfurt School\u2019s theories of law and justice in terms of theories of discourse and recognition.Feminism, the ethic or care and the critique of legal justiceThe post-structuralist deconstruction of law and justice", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Law, Society and Criminology", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {"JURD7336": 1, "JURD7236": 1, "LAWS2326": 1}, "exclusions": {"JURD7336": 1}, "path_to": {}, "terms": ["T2", "T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "LAWS3327": {"title": "Law Schools Global League Summer School", "code": "LAWS3327", "UOC": 12, "level": 3, "description": "The LSGL Summer School is an annual summer school hosted by the Law Schools Global League that contains four course modules, which have historically included, for instance, modules on Climate Change, Justice and Courts; New Trends in International Taxation; Corporate Governance (From Comparative to Global); and Current Challenges in Trade and Investment Law.

Why do we do these things? Is it because we want to do the \u201cright\u201d thing? Or simply because it is the law? Put differently: why do humans need and create laws and what do we aim to accomplish through law?\n\nWithin the Western tradition, law often reflects religious values (for example, those of the Ten Commandments) while Roman Law established the first sophisticated \u201crule of law\u201d. From the authoritarian commands of Kings, Queens or dictators to the promise of \u201csocial contracts\u201d and modern deliberative democracy, law has developed into a highly complex tool to organize the way we live together. It is now perceived as safe-guarding our freedom and equality, as solidifying the power of economic and political elites, empowering minorities to fight racism and discrimination, a tool to control property and territory, and organize global flows of people and products. Law is, most importantly, also our main instrument to overcome violence and injustice, punish, settle conflicts and create reconciliation.\n\nThe course examines all these aspects in a historical, analytical and critical manner by showcasing different legal-philosophical positions, mainly taken from the Western jurisprudential canon while also looking at Indigenous and Asian perspectives. Some of the theories we engage with are: Natural Law, Legal Positivism, Legal Hermeneutics, Legal Realism, Feminist Jurisprudence, Legal Pluralism, Legal Pragmatism. In addition, the course engages with the wider framework of law: moral and political philosophy. \u00a0\n\nIn sum, Legal Theory reflects on fundamental problems of modern law from a legal, moral and political perspective and provides students with a deeper understanding of the presuppositions that inform law, legal institutions and their own future professional practices. Its ultimate goal is to clarify what it means to be \u2018before the law\u2019 and if, how and where \u2018law meets justice\u2019.\n", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Law, Society and Criminology", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {"LAWS2320": 1, "JURD7431": 1, "JURD7223": 1}, "exclusions": {}, "path_to": {}, "terms": ["T1", "T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "LAWS3332": {"title": "Law and Social Theory", "code": "LAWS3332", "UOC": 6, "level": 3, "description": "LAWS3332 is an Elective.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society.\u00a0 Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them. Theoretical investigation looks beneath what we all too often take for granted, to see what accounts for it, how it works, and how it changes.\u00a0\n\nSocial theory is a particular way of asking theoretical questions, which tries to explain why things are as they are by examining the social practices and institutions that shape the way that people live.\u00a0 To study law and social theory is to explore theoretical issues that arise when we see law as one part of this broader social context.\u00a0\n\nSome of the questions that we address in the course include: what social functions are played by legal systems, and the modern legal system in particular? How does law intersect with other social systems, practices, and forms of power?\u00a0 How, for example, is the legal system influenced by the economy, and how does it shape the economy in turn?\u00a0 What is the relationship between the legal system and political actors, such as the state, bureaucracy, classes and social movements?\u00a0 How does law shape, and how is it influenced by, socially dominant ways of thinking, such as ideology, rationality, or beliefs about class, gender, and race?\u00a0 What drives change in the legal system?\u00a0 Is it, for example, the practices of lawyers, politicians, or social movements?\u00a0 Is it the evolution of ideas? Or economic imperatives?\u00a0\n\nWe will explore these questions in both an historical and contemporary context.\u00a0 We will examine the work of the foundational thinkers in the tradition of social theory, such as Karl Marx and Max Weber, who were responding to the massive social, economic, scientific and intellectual changes of the nineteenth century.\u00a0 Their work continues to provide insight into the relationship between law and society, because the contemporary world, has inherited many of the ideas and institutions that came to dominate society in their time, including the market economy, democracy, and liberal individualism.\u00a0 The course also engages with more contemporary theorists whose work responds to the changing social and legal landscape of the 20th and 21st centuries.\u00a0 This may include the work of Michel Foucault, systems theory, feminist criticism, or theories of biopolitics.\u00a0 We will draw on these thinkers, not only to reflect on the themes of the course, but to think about pressing issues, such as the impact of neoliberalism and globalisation on the law, the treatment of refugees, emergency politics and constitutional democracy, and the legal and political response to climate change.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStudying theories of law and society will hopefully lead us beyond our original, and usually quite unreflective views of what is important in law, what role it plays in society, whose interests it serves, what causes legal change, and how important law is. In probing these questions, we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.\n\n\u00a0\n", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Law, Society and Criminology", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {"JURD7222": 1, "JURD7632": 1, "LAWS2820": 1}, "exclusions": {}, "path_to": {}, "terms": ["T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "LAWS3335": {"title": "Economic Analysis of Law", "code": "LAWS3335", "UOC": 6, "level": 3, "description": "This course provides an introduction to economic analysis of law and policy.\nMain Topics\nLegal topics\nContractual damagesSurrogacy lawEnvironmental law and wind powerIndigenous rights and miningSex discrimination lawInternational rights to cultural property\nEconomic topics/concepts\nPareto EfficiencyRational Risk-takingBehavioural BiasesMoral HazardAsymmetric InformationExternalitiesPublic Choice or Interest Group TheoriesSocial Choice TheoryGame TheoryEmpirical Legal Methods\n", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Global and Public Law", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {}, "exclusions": {"JURD7335": 1}, "path_to": {}, "terms": [""], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "LAWS3341": {"title": "Gender and Law", "code": "LAWS3341", "UOC": 6, "level": 3, "description": "The law is not a neutral body of rules and legal categories it often excludes groups reinforcing their disadvantage.Gender discrimination, along with other forms of discrimination, is embedded throughout the legal system, often in ways that are not immediately obvious.

A typical form of these measures is an imposition of additional import duties on the top of the standard ones. WTO members are free to resort to trade remedies but must follow the relevant WTO rules.\nThis course offers a comprehensive and detailed study of the laws and practice of trade remedies. It studies the rationale for trade remedies; the domestic law and practice in selected countries with a focus on Australia (as an active user of trade remedies) and China (as a major target of trade remedies worldwide); the relevant WTO rules and major dispute settlement cases; negotiations of reforms of WTO rules on trade remedies; and the regulation of trade remedies under free trade agreements (FTAs). The course offers abundant opportunities for students to gain legal expertise and practical experience through case studies, simulation, and face-to-face discussion with leading trade and commercial lawyers. As the laws and practice of trade remedies in different jurisdictions share common features and create common issues, this course will provide the knowledge and practical skills necessary for further studies and trade law practice in all major jurisdictions (e.g. Australia, China, the US, the EU, Canada, and India).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Private and Commercial Law", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {"JURD7554": 1}, "exclusions": {}, "path_to": {}, "terms": ["T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "LAWS3356": {"title": "Innovation Law and Policy", "code": "LAWS3356", "UOC": 6, "level": 3, "description": "", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Private and Commercial Law", "faculty": "Faculty of Law and Justice", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {}, "exclusions": {}, "path_to": {}, "terms": [""], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "LAWS3361": {"title": "Environmental Law", "code": "LAWS3361", "UOC": 6, "level": 3, "description": "This course introduces the fundamental principles and concepts of environmental law and policy.

This enables students to not only learn about trial practice first hand but, with classroom discussion and the readings, better appreciate its relationship to doctrinal theory. The observation requirement is also built into the final assessment, which is an essay-based analysis with a choice between two topics. One topic asks students to compare the conduct and practices of participants in observed trials withwhat the law expects, requires or assumes. The other (alternate) topic requires students to explore a miscarriage of justice scenario of their own choice.

However, it is important to remember that many product-based organisations (e.g., IBM, Federal Express) have a strong service component.\u00a0\nThis course was developed because for business, in any industry, service provision is a key differentiator. The implications of service provision, and how services are best managed and marketed, are steadily gaining importance. Therefore, students who plan to work in service industries, or the customer service division of manufacturing industries, must be prepared sufficiently to do so. This course aims to help students understand the practical implications of the unique characteristics of services and service provision and to help them cope with the challenges of marketing and managing a service. To achieve this aim, we build upon, and expand, marketing management concepts and models, demonstrating how they apply to the services sector. This course focuses on the\u00a0distinctive characteristics and problems of marketing in service organizations and for any organization developing and marketing services as part of its business portfolio. It demonstrates why and how services require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy-both in its development and in its execution.

In particular, an axiomatic approach infiltrated the mathematical paradigm, both as a tool to ensure mathematical rigour and to abstract common principles working in a variety of different settings.\n\nFirst year mathematics emphasizes computation over abstraction and rigour. Later year courses (and Pure Mathematics in general) reverse this, so students need to learn some new skills and some new ways of thinking about mathematical objects.\n\nThis course is designed to help you develop the ability to write rigorous mathematical proofs in a setting where the level of abstraction is still quite modest. As such it will serve as an excellent preparation for the third year Pure Mathematics courses.\n\nThe course consists of two halves, algebra and analysis, each taught for 6 weeks.\nAnalysis half. Most of the calculus you have seen involves equalities. Mathematical analysis\u00a0however, is largely about inequalities, about suitably bounding quantities that cannot be calculated precisely. Many nice examples come from geometry and we will frequently use these to motivate our discussion in the first part of the analysis section. In the latter part we will look\u00a0more closely at some aspects of the real numbers, such as how well one can approximate \u03c0 by a rational p/q\u00a0(in terms of how large q\u00a0is).\n\nAlgebra half. We will investigate various transformations on the plane and projective plane. We will first study several types of transformations such as translations, reflections, rotations etc. in terms of groups. We will then look at symmetries, i.e. transformations of geometric figures that\u00a0preserve some property (such as distance or angles between lines), and projective geometry.

The main analytical tools developed in this course can be thought of as generalisations of the Fourier and power series representations of functions studied in MATH2120. This leads to new types of functions and to practical methods for solving differential equations. We will pay special attention to functions defined on infinite domains.\n\nThe course begins by characterising different partial differential equations (PDEs), and exploring similarity solutions and the method of characteristics to solve them. The Fourier transform, the natural extension of a Fourier series expansion is then investigated. For functions of time, the Fourier transform corresponds to the \u201cspectrum\u201d of the function or signal in the problem in the frequency domain. Closely related to the Fourier transform is the Laplace transform which is particularly useful for solving the initial value PDEs that arise in many physical applications. Although contour integration is an intrinsic part of using these transforms, only brief references to complex variable methods will be made.\n\nTransforms give a wide insight into the behaviour of a function and suggests other possibilities for the integral representation of solutions of PDEs. By exploiting certain special solutions of a given linear PDE we eventually obtain the idea of a Green&#39;s function for the PDE and a corresponding integral form for the solution. The power of Green&#39;s functions can be observed in their use as the inverses of differential operators on both infinite and bounded domains.\n\nFrequently it is not possible to evaluate in closed form the Fourier, Laplace or Green\u2019s function integrals appearing in the solution of the given PDE.

Students enrolling should be in the final year of study or nearing completion of their computing degree.\nThis capstone course covers these professional skills and competencies through two main themes:Software Project Management:Through a group project, students will gain practical experience in all phases of the planning and execution of a software project, including requirements scoping, agile software process methodology, project planning and scheduling, teamwork and communication, and risk and change management.Professional Issues and Ethics:Students will gain an appreciation of the responsibilities of a professional software engineer and apply ethical theories and reasoning to IT industry issues such as software quality, privacy and security, intellectual property and legal obligations of IT practitioners.", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Computer Science and Engineering", "faculty": "Faculty of Engineering", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {}, "exclusions": {"COMP2920": 1, "BINF4920": 1, "COMP4920": 1, "SENG4921": 1}, "path_to": {}, "terms": ["T1", "T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {"COMP2511": 1}}, "SERV9999": {"title": "Tourism & Event Mgt: Sustaining the Attraction of Aust", "code": "SERV9999", "UOC": 6, "level": 9, "description": "This 5 week short course is specifically designed for International students.\u00a0The course comprises lectures, industry case studies and presentations, field excursions and travel throughout some of the most prominent and diverse tourist destinations in Australia.

The user of the FE method has to decide what kind of elements should be used, and how many of them? Where should the mesh be fine and where may it be coarse? Can the model be simplified? How accurate will the answers be, and how can they be checked? One need not understand all the mathematics of the finite element to answer these questions. However a competent user must have an understanding of the preliminary mathematics and must be able to understand how elements behave in order to choose suitable kinds, sizes and shapes of elements, and to guard against misinterpretations and unrealistically high expectations. This course is a balanced theoretical and practical introduction to the use of the FE method. The first part deals with mathematical preliminaries such as the weighted residual methods, finite element approximation and numerical integration.

Plato, one of the West\u2019s most famous and influential philosophers, spent a good deal of thought on what constitutes the ideal city, who would be its legitimate and illegitimate inhabitants and who would govern it.\n\nIn modern times the goal of influencing behaviour through city planning is clearly evident. Modernists such as Baron von Hausmann and Le Corbusier and, closer to home, Walter Burley Griffin, recognised the role that space played in shaping the behaviour of individuals and in shaping the direction of society. Yet although space can be planned to some degree to direct people to act, speak and even think in certain ways, there are of course many other facets of human action that thwart the best laid plans. The unpredictability of human action ensures a constantly changing landscape, which can only be explained by understanding the interplay between people and space.\n\nThe material examined is topical in nature and includes Australian and international examples, with a focus on urban environments. This course is designed to open your eyes to different interpretations of places, events and behaviours.\n\nThe aim of the course, using real-world, student-driven case studies, is for you to have a deep appreciation of the relationship between environments and the behaviours and opportunities of people living in these environments.

This volatility has significant implications for the ways in which we are able, or not, to live our lives today and for the future sustainability of political-economic practice. You will be asked in this course to work out what these implications are, and how they have arisen, by examining the global political economy in a variety of forms, and through multiple perspectives. You will be encouraged to think reflectively and imaginatively about questions in the GPE for which there are no easy answers, including questions of power, privilege, common sense, instability and the ongoing role of crisis-driven capitalist growth. You will be asked to make decisions about your views on the apparently systemic nature of capitalist instability. Together, we will decide to what extent, and why, the global political economy has been dominated by crisis, developing an understanding of the structure and practices of global political-economic relations, in historical and contemporary perspective.\n", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "school": "School of Social Sciences", "faculty": "Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture", "campus": "Sydney", "equivalents": {}, "exclusions": {}, "path_to": {}, "terms": ["T3"], "gen_ed": 0, "path_from": {}}, "ARTS3814": {"title": "Australian Foreign Policy", "code": "ARTS3814", "UOC": 6, "level": 3, "description": "This course introduces you to the theory and practice of Australian foreign policy across a range of key relationships and policy areas in both historical and contemporary terms.

You will explore a range of significant policy areas, including defence and national security, trade, foreign aid, and immigration. The emphasis is on developing a critical understanding of Australian foreign policy, Australia&#39;s international interests and the ways in which those interests are pursued.
