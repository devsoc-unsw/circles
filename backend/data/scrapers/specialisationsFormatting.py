"""
Program formats scraped / raw data by filtering out superfluous fields and 
applying minor formatting to relevant fields. It creates the file
'specialisationFormattedRaw.json'.

Within 'contentLets', relevant info includes:
 - creditPoints
 - studyLevel (e.g. 'undergraduate')
 - code (i.e. unique identifier for specialisation)
 - title (e.g. 'Accounting')
 - data (see below)
 - CurriculumStructure (see below)
 - additionalInfo
 - hb_enrolment_rules (i.e. constraints such as a maturity rule)

'data' includes, but is not limited to:
 - ELS requirements (not currently extracted)
 - structure summary
 - school detail
 - faculty detail
 - programs that the specialisation is available in
 - specialisation constraints (e.g. maturity rule)

'curriculumStructure' sets out the courses required to satisfy the specialisation.
Relevant info is located in a list of dictionaries titled 'container'. Each of 
these dictionaries includes:
 - title
 - description
 - relationship
 - dynamic_relationship
 - container 

The required courses are either in 'relationship', 'dynamic_relationship', or 
in deeper levels of 'container' (which has been accessed via recursion in
the below code).
