These include Sir John Cornforth; and for Medicine with a substantial chemistry component - Florey (1945), - MacFarlane Burnett (1960), - Eccles (1963), - Doherty (1996) and - Blackburn (2009). W.H. Bragg, W.L Bragg won the prize in Physics (1915), which led to major advances in chemistry, biology and material science.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry has prominence in the modern world via applications involving nanotechnologies and popular compact electronic devices of everyday use. However, there are many more chemical uses that that support modern society and occupy many roles without being noticed or even pondered.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry is science at the molecular level. Chemical science underpins defence technology at every level from lasers and high-speed computers to food science and energetic materials. Ordnance and Engineering are particular areas where UNSW Canberra Chemistry majors have found employment.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry is divided into several sub-fields. The School of PEMS has strengths in Physical and Theoretical Chemistry as well as Inorganic and Organic Chemistry. Within each of these sub-fields there are specialist fields of laser spectroscopy, biological chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, explosives and molecular design.

Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics within the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours Program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Palaeoscience stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline. <strong>Please note:</strong> this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program in Geography are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program receive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

As a student studying the Indigenous Studies Major, you will be led in a sequential way to understand that solutions in practice requires deep, ongoing, critical reflection at the level of theory and practice.</p>\n\n<p>The learning experience across the levels has been configured to allow for transferability of skills and knowledge into other contexts.</p>\n\n<p>You will begin by focusing on the continuities of Indigenous ways of understanding the world. In this way you will be drawn into an awareness of Indigenous knowledge and tradition as an organiser of Indigenous worlds and continuing Indigenous practices. This alerts you to your prior assumptions, positions the contests that occur within Indigenous Studies, and prepares you for deeper intellectual inquiry at levels two and three.</p>\n\n<p>The Indigenous Studies Major culminates in a capstone course, where you will practice navigating a range of issues potentially encountered in the workplace. Understanding Indigenous knowledge and practice, and the historical relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia are required for comprehension of the complex mix of continuities, ruptures and convergences that condition the contemporary Indigenous position and how it can be understood.</p>\n\n<p>The Indigenous Studies Major is designed for those of you seeking to specialise in Indigenous Studies as the central focus of your degree program. If you are interested in Indigenous Studies, but do not have room in your program, you may consider studying an Indigenous Studies Minor or Indigenous Studies Minor Extended.</p>\n",

The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Molecular and Cell Biology can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Molecular and Cell Biology is to be completed full-time. Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with the undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516 BABS Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM lower than 65 and/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about the process of applying for Honours can be found here <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours</a>, and other appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date (typically February for S1 and June for S2).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Molecular and Cell Biology may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Molecular and Cell Biology have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n",

The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Genetics can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Genetics is to be completed full-time.

The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about the process of applying for Honours can be found here <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours</a>, and other appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Genetics may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Genetics have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",

These advances have opened up the exciting field of Molecular Biology, one of the most rapid growth areas in biology. This marriage of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Cell Biology provides an exciting new approach for the study of all living organisms, including the human. Molecular Biology therefore represents fundamental components of biological and medical science and they will have increasingly important roles to play in many aspects of modern medicine, genetics, evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, biotechnology and genomics.",

Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Biology stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline: <strong>Please note:</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Biology receive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc) and in the public sector (Local, State or Federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Biotechnology can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Biotechnology is to be completed full-time.\u00a0Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3).

The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors.

Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Biotechnology may find employment in research, government and industry.

        "description": "<p>Chemical Product Engineering involves researching, developing and improving the properties of the products that we use every day through the selection and design of the materials that are used. Product engineers work on the fluids that you use in your everyday life, including chemicals (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, shampoos, paints, glues), foods, and drinks. As a product engineer, you will learn to take consumer needs and turn them into technical requirements, finding the right combinations of chemicals to deliver those properties and then developing the product and strategies for commercialisation and manufacture. You will learn how to apply your knowledge of engineering and chemistry to design complex chemical products for the pharmaceutical, consumer products and food industries. You&#39;ll master the entire development process, testing out ideas for products and extrapolating small scale, laboratory chemistry into large, industrial scale production. In the final year Product Design Project, you will work with industry partners to develop a new consumer product up to the point where it could be patented and commercialised. To get work ready, you&#39;ll apply these skills through 60 days of approved industry training.<br /><br />The courses listed below have to be completed to finish the degree, but the order in which they are taken is important and you need to follow advice on this. Many courses are offered only once per year and others have pre-requisites or exclusions which govern the order in which they can be taken. Both of these things can have a big impact on enrolment planning if poor choices of course combinations are made. You are strongly encouraged to consult the School website and follow the recommended course sequence linked <a href=\"https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/study-with-us/undergraduate-degrees/chemical-product-engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br /><br />The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimise your choice of courses. It is your responsibility to plan your enrolment appropriately. Assistance is available from Engineering Student Support Services, should you require it.</p>",

Inclusion of advanced level studies from more than one field of specialisation results in a broadly based degree in the chemical sciences. For example, a combination of Chemistry and Biochemistry leads to further work in areas such as toxicology and neurochemistry. Combining Level III Chemistry with Mathematics provides a valuable basis for the many applications of computers in Chemistry.

Inclusion of advanced level studies from more than one field of specialisation results in a broadly based degree in the chemical sciences. For example, a combination of Chemistry and Biochemistry leads to further work in areas such as toxicology and neurochemistry. Combining Level III Chemistry with Mathematics provides a valuable basis for the many applications of computers in Chemistry. Chemistry with Physics or Materials Science allows entry into the rapidly developing field of advanced materials.",

Students in Chemistry Honours undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations.<br />\n<br />\nThe learning and teaching philosophy underpinning Chemistry Honours is centred on students taking on their &#39;role as a researcher&#39; to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge, with some degree of independence.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to the research project, Chemistry Honours includes formal coursework and requires attendance at School seminars, aimed at broadening a graduate&#39;s knowledge. Most students would complete Honours as full-time students, where the program is completed over two consecutive semesters. Part-time study is also possible depending on availability of supervision and suitable projects.<br />\n<br />\nStudent research projects are available across the full range of Chemistry disciplines, with a focus on our School\u2019s major research themes of Catalysis and Energy, Nanoscience, and Medicinal Chemistry. Further information on the Honours program and the School\u2019s research can be found on the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chemistry.unsw.edu.au/current-students/undergraduate/honours-research\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chemistry Honours</a>\u00a0page and the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chemistry.unsw.edu.au/research/research-themes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chemistry Research Themes</a>\u00a0page.<br />\n<br />\nMost students commence their enrolment in a trimester (commonly T1 and T3). Students are expected to commence work on their project in Week 1 of their first trimester. Honours typically runs until mid-November (T1 commencement) or end of their final trimester. Students should check the Chemistry Honours webpages for current enrolment deadlines, and assessment and completion dates.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chemistry Honours stream involves undertaking a research project that, although conducted under supervision, contains substantial independent research and self-direction. The research project is described in a submitted Project Thesis that forms the largest component of the assessment. The Project Thesis is complemented by introductory written and oral background presentations, oral presentation of the research project, and an oral examination (viva voce). Students are also required to attend compulsory Workplace Health and Safety training, relevant inductions, as well as School seminars.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chemistry Honours stream also contains an advanced coursework component.

A critical part of the evaluation of the Thesis will include assessment of a student\u2019s research performance throughout the year including motivation, organisational skills, research (laboratory) skills, note-keeping, critical analysis and communication skills.<br />\n<br />\nStudents are also required to deliver a formal 20 minute presentation covering the results of the research, and to defend their research in an oral examination.<br />\n<br />\nAttendance at School seminars is also a compulsory part of the Honours program.<br />\n<br />\nThe breakdown of assessment for the Research Project Thesis mark is as follows:<br />\nThesis mark 60% (45% of final Honours mark)<br />\nFinal seminar 15% (11.25% of final Honours mark)<br />\nOral examination 25% (18.75% of final Honours mark)<br />\nHonours Grade Calculation<br />\n<br />\nA student\u2019s Honours mark is the Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of the marks obtained in CHEM4501 Chemistry Project Proposal and Research Skills (6 UOC), CHEM4502 Chemistry Honours Coursework (6 UOC), plus the Research Project (36 UOC).<br />\n<br />\nThe overall contributions of the various components to the final Honours grade are as follows:<br />\nHonours Coursework (12.5%)<br />\nProject Proposal and Research Skills (12.5%)<br />\nResearch Project Thesis (75%)<br />\nA guide to allocation of Honours classes and what is expected of students within the School of Chemistry is as follows:<br />\n<br />\nFinal Mark &gt;85 (Honours Class 1)<br />\n<br />\nWork of superior quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, demonstrating the ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, the integration of information from a wide range of sources and containing clear examples of excellent critical evaluation.<br />\n<br />\nFinal Mark 75-84 (Honours Class 2.1)<br />\n<br />\nWork of very good quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, but showing lesser ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, integrate information from range of sources and critically evaluate the literature and research data.<br />\n<br />\nFinal Mark 65-74 (Honours Class 2.2)<br />\n<br />\nGood quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation but with inadequacies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.<br />\n<br />\nFinal Mark 50-64 (Honours Class 3)<br />\n<br />\nAdequate quality work with significant deficiencies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.<br />\nAdmission Requirements and Process<br />\n<br />\nAdmission Requirements<br />\n<br />\nThe Chemistry Honours stream in Program 4500 Science (Honours) is available to all students who have met the entry requirements outlined below and is typically offered to 3970 Science, 3987 Science International and 3925 Science and Business students at UNSW who have completed a Chemistry major including students enrolled in dual program combinations with these Science programs (see the UNSW Online Handbook for details). Exceptions to these requirements will only be permitted with the consent of the Head of School or nominee (Honours Coordinator). External students should provide evidence of equivalent study and will require approval of the Head of School or nominee (Honours Coordinator).<br />\n<br />\nOther requirements for entry to Honours in Chemistry are as shown below:<br />\nA credit average (&#61;65% WAM) for all undergraduate Science courses.<br />\nA credit average for all Level II and III courses in the Chemistry major.<br />\nAn applicant with an overall WAM of between 60 to 64 will require the permission of the Head of School to enrol in Honours in Chemistry.<br />\nAdmission Process<br />\n<br />\nStudents who meet the entry requirements should make contact with potential supervisors aligning with their interests and discuss undertaking Honours with them. Potential students should then apply for acceptance into the stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the Chemistry Honours page. Students accepted into the program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.<br />\n<br />\nSupervisors and potential projects can also be found on the Chemistry Honours page. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via the Chemistry Research page.<br />\nPathways<br />\n<br />\nStudents who successfully complete Chemistry Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students with successful Honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW. Students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies. Further information can be obtained from the postgraduate studies page.<br />\n<br />\nGraduates of Chemistry Honours are well qualified to work in any Chemistry or associated research laboratory as a Research Assistant or Research Technician. Graduates may also find employment in the public or private sectors either using their chemistry skills directly, or alternatively in a range of other fields using the analytical and research skills developed during the Honours year. For more information see the School of Chemistry\u2019s Careers page.<br />\n<br />\nPotential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought.</p>\n",

The major stream in Chinese Studies encompasses the study of Chinese language and communication as well as culture, society and civilisation, including Chinese literature, cinema, history, politics and philosophy. A background in Chinese Studies is useful in many areas of professional specialisation, from commerce and the business sector to tourism, the media, the public service sector and education.<br />\n<br />\nThere are two main components of Chinese Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the Chinese language. Acquiring language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of socio-cultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending others\u2019 expression, both oral and written. The ability to read written texts is an important part of this process. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Chinese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform an understanding of Chinese culture. These disciplines include literary, cultural, film, translation, gender, and media studies as well as anthropological, linguistic, historical and sociological approaches.<br />\n<br />\nThis stream is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Placement Information</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe School of Humanities and Languages offers a flexible program for students with different interests and different Chinese language backgrounds. You can enter Chinese language courses at different levels, depending on your knowledge of Chinese characters. Within each year, you are allocated to different groups, depending on your speaking ability.<br />\n<br />\nIf you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found on the web at: <a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">hal.arts.unsw.edu.au</a><br />\n<br />\nYou will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you in terms of Chinese character knowledge. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.<br />\n<br />\nIf you are admitted in your first year of study to ARTS2450 or higher on the grounds of your ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of your degree requirements.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>Chinese is a fascinating modern language with a rich cultural heritage and an increasingly important medium in global business and communication. The major stream in Advanced Chinese Studies encompasses the study of Chinese language and communication as well as culture, society and civilisation, including Chinese literature, cinema, history, politics and philosophy. A background in Chinese Studies is useful in many areas of professional specialisation, from commerce and the business sector to tourism, the media, the public service sector and education.<br />\n<br />\nThere are two main components of Chinese Studies. The first is a focus on acquiring / enhancing competence in the Chinese language. Language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of socio-cultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending others\u2019 expression, both oral and written. The ability to read written texts is an important part of this. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Chinese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform an understanding of Chinese culture. These disciplines include literary, cultural, film, translation, gender, and media studies as well as anthropological, linguistic, historical and sociological approaches.<br />\n<br />\nThis stream is available to students commencing at Advanced, Professional and Expert entry levels.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Placement Information</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe School of Humanities and Languages offers a flexible program for students with different interests and different Chinese language backgrounds. You can enter Chinese language courses at different levels, depending on your knowledge of Chinese characters. Within each year, you are allocated to different groups, depending on your speaking ability.<br />\n<br />\nIf you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found on the web at: <a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">hal.arts.unsw.edu.au</a><br />\n<br />\nYou will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you in terms of Chinese character knowledge. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.<br />\n<br />\nIf you are admitted in your first year of study to ARTS2450 or higher on the grounds of your ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of your degree requirements.<br />\n<br />\nYou will be admitted to the Expert level of entry to the Major if you have completed high school in China or have elsewhere achieved equivalent language proficiency to a Chinese high school graduate. This level emphasises Chinese Studies (contextual and professional) courses. Since you already have a high level of language proficiency and literacy in Chinese, you will enroll in Translation and Interpreting courses as Gateway language courses \u2013 which are a requirement for the major at this entry level.</p>\n",

Honours in Climate Science introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in climate dynamics, global climate change, and extremes of weather and climate. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include a literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial\u00a0 independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics in the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible for students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.<br /><br />Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.<br /><br />Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.<br /><br /><em>Admission Process</em><br /><br />Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Climate Science stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the BEES Honours Program webpage (<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours</a>). It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via UNSW Research (<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research.unsw.edu.au</a>). Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.<br /><br /><strong>Pathways</strong><br /><br />Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Climate Science receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.<br /><br />Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

Economic development is proceeding rapidly in some countries and among some communities, while others are being left behind. Urbanisation is accelerating; disparities are widening; the environment is threatened; communication and other technologies have been transformed\u2014how do we grapple with these changes, their pace, the winners and losers? The field of development studies explores these issues and navigates the tools and traps for addressing them.</p>\n<p>Many of the world\u2019s greatest challenges require knowledge of the underlying causes, variations, and diverse consequences.\u00a0Global\u00a0Development is concerned with identifying processes of uneven development, impacts, and responses at the local, national, and global levels. Situations are complex, requiring interdisciplinary engagements and a deep understanding of context.\u00a0Global\u00a0Development is a field driven by knowledge \u2018on the ground\u2019 in order to connect the experiences of people in their everyday lives with larger national and global processes of change.\u00a0Global\u00a0Development students learn to critically analyse change and develop the tools to investigate and address changes taking place all over the world.\u00a0Global\u00a0Development graduates ensure that research and practice is done in line with ethical principles, in ways that mitigate negative consequences and at its best, improve the lives of people.</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>",

How database systems are applied can critically affect the success of an organisation. In the future, the management of very large volumes of organisational data will be an essential component of the livelihood and growth of every organisation.<br />\n<br />\nSince databases are so widely used, potential employers include any organisation that relies on the effective management of data. Obvious examples of large organisations with significant data management needs are financial institutions, telecommunications companies, manufacturing enterprises, and government departments. However, employment is not limited to such organisations, since data management is also critical in medium and small enterprises, such as scientific research labs and small businesses.<br />\n<br />\nThe Database Systems stream in the Computer Science program exposes students both to the foundations of DBMS architecture (essential knowledge for database administrators) as well as to the principles behind leading edge applications of databases, such as e-Commerce, data warehousing, and data mining.",

        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), once simply a branch of computing research, has over the last decade moved into the mainstream of computational problem solving techniques. Many systems, from search engines to financial systems and health systems employ AI techniques such as machine learning. While true &#39;intelligence&#39; via computers is still remote, AI techniques are increasingly being used to enhance the performance of a vast range of existing systems, and to enable new applications, especially those involving large amounts of data.<br />\n<br />\nIn many applications (e.g. driverless vehicles), AI allows existing systems to work with less and less manual intervention. As autonomous devices become more common, potential employers include companies that can make ready use of automation. This includes companies concerned with home and office automation, entertainment companies and autonomous systems research and development. Autonomous systems and the sophisticated sensors they employ are also adopted in many industries to enhance production and to improve safety (e.g. mining, manufacturing, transport).<br />\n<br />\nThis stream introduces students to the foundations of artificial intelligence and the core technologies (machine learning, knowledge representation) that are required to apply AI in the real world.",

This is a high demand area of employment and is forecast to have serious undersupply of graduates to at least 2025. The cyber security education design is based on the security approaches of Ross Anderson and Bruce Schneier and incorporates an explicit engineering focus to security, rather than the more usual ad hoc &#34;hacker&#34;?, or commercial &#34;responsive&#34;? approaches of cyber security education.<br />\n<br />\nThe core courses in the stream teach analysis and systematic professional approaches to engineering security and examine failures, bugs, and human / system interactions and issues. There is an ongoing focus on security by design and professional ethical security practice.<br />\n<br />\nSpecialist elective courses allow students to specialise in their areas of interest and skill. Graduates of the stream are equipped for careers in penetration testing, incident response, software assessment, malware analysis, forensics, military or law enforcement, security consulting, and security lead in dev teams. This stream relies on students being exposed to C and to secure coding and vulnerabilities in first year including: memory use (data representation, the heap, function calls and the stack), and some assembly.",

The interdisciplinary environment at UNSW will also help you forge links with other areas of creative production such as screen writing, media and performing arts.</p>\n\n<p>Through workshop-based core courses at each level of the major, you will learn how to generate, draft, revise and edit your own writing, and to locate that writing in the context of both literary history and current literary trends. You will be exposed to new experimental techniques of writing and given the opportunity to reflect on how you want to contribute to literary culture. At the same time you will hone your critical and analytical skills to enable you to appraise and assess both your own work and the work of other writers.</p>\n\n<p>Prescribed electives at each level are offered to complement your writing with a more formal knowledge of literary genres and movements. The major challenges you to integrate a rigorous critical competency in areas such as poetics and narrative theory into the aesthetic choices you make as a writer. It also challenges you to consider the broader cultural and political implications of those choices and to imagine how you can engage with critical ideas and social debate through and in your own writing. Electives in other disciplines offer the opportunity to extend your writing skills in other media forms and establish formal connections with majors in film studies, media studies, and theatre and performance studies.</p>\n",

Flexibility and choice are maintained throughout the entire structure by providing many elective courses.<br />\n<br />\nEnvironmental engineers are concerned with the environmental impact of engineering activities. They apply their broad knowledge of engineering and environmental processes in identifying environmental problems and in developing effective solutions to them. They also coordinate the activities of specialist groups such as biologists, ecologists and geologists within major projects. The discipline of environmental engineering embraces parts of civil engineering, with emphasis on management, systems design, water, geotechnical and transport engineering, together with aspects of chemical engineering, applied and biological sciences and environmental studies.<br />\n<br />\nThis stream can be taken on a four-year full-time basis or on a part-time basis subject to the approval of the Head of School. Intending part-time students are advised that all courses are offered only in the daytime.<br />\n<br />\nA detailed stream structure can be found on the School website, which includes suggested scheduling of courses by semester. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.",

A large corporation, for example, may borrow funds to purchase new plant and equipment by issuing further stock while an individual may save by purchasing stocks or government bonds. Markets for financial instruments also arise because firms and individuals want to manage financial risk. For example, a large corporation may bet against the risk of large fluctuations in the Australian - U.S. dollar exchange rate by selling its goods by way of futures contracts. Understanding how the prices of financial instruments are determined in the market place is a central concern of financial economics, along with the design of new financial derivatives.<br />\n<br />\nThe area of financial economics that deals with the study of real-world data is known as financial econometrics. Financial econometrics is concerned with the statistical analysis of financial data and testing the real-world applicability of asset-pricing theories. This major provides students with a thorough understanding of the economic principles that underlie the pricing and allocative role of all financial assets, whether they are stocks, bonds, futures or options.</p>\n",

For over 100 years, it has been known that the behaviour of physical systems at the atomic scale does not obey the familiar laws of classical physics. Atomic-size systems behave according to quantum mechanics, which allows them to exhibit rather spectacular properties and dynamics. This stream trains students to design and operate devices that behave according to quantum mechanics, opening the possibility to exploit the peculiar laws of quantum physics to perform otherwise cumbersome or impossible tasks, such as the efficient solution of computationally hard problems, or the secure teleportation of information. Graduates from this stream will have valuable skills that position them ideally for the burgeoning quantum engineering industry, as well as broad skills across most key electrical engineering disciplines.</p>",

Honours in Environmental Management introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the biological, ecological and environmental sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project\u00a0 under the close supervision of academics in the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>\n",

Entry is also possible for students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Environmental Management must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Environmental Management (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weighted average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Environmental Management stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the BEES Honours Program webpage (<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours</a>). It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via UNSW Research (<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research.unsw.edu.au</a>). Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Environmental Management receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Financial Technology (FinTech) is a rapidly growing field in finance where technology is used to enhance and reimagine financial services and sometimes results in disruptive changes. The most well-known examples are payment systems (PayPal, WeChat, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency), portfolio management and Robo-advice (US, Europe, Australia), peer-to-peer lending (US, China, India and elsewhere), high-frequency trading (global), and decentralized finance (of which Bitcoin and cryptocurrency form the foundation). Established financial services firms (BigTech) and entrepreneurs (FinTech) both demand talent in this space as FinTech products are by nature scalable and have potential for huge impact in a financial services business.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Co-developed with financial services industry experts, this major introduces students to finance theory, financial products, markets, and institutions, then explores how big data and other technologies allow FinTech start-ups to cause consumers to shift away from traditional finance - fundamentally changing the way money is raised, transferred, stored, loaned, and invested around the world. In addition to a conceptual understanding of finance theory, financial markets, and financial services firms, students will experience FinTech courses via the Integrated Learning Laboratory (iLab). They will be able to gain personal access to financial market data platforms, handle financial market and unstructured data, learn how financial products work via the Python programming language, trade using the leading stock trading platform used by brokerage firms, and interact with practitioners.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Bachelor of Commerce (Financial Technology) major can be taken standalone or be taken to complement other streams of studies such as finance, information system, computer science, engineering, law, and more. It is also available as a minor for students with a constrained degree program.</p>\n",

Courses are offered from the introductory level to the advanced and professional levels. Students not only develop their knowledge of the French language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the French-speaking world. They study cultures, communities, societies and literature in France and the Francophone world. The French language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Learning French will provide students with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in French will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main components of language study. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other people&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the French language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of French and Francophone cultures. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the French language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n\n<ol><li>to foster understanding of the experiences and world-views of French and Francophone cultures;</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies where French is spoken;</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis-\u00e0\u00a0-vis French and Francophone societies and cultures;</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about French and Francophone societies, cultures, and the arts;</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This stream is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For students admitted in their first year of study to ARTS2480 or higher on the grounds of ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of degree requirements.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>The major in Advanced French Studies enables students to study French at a number of levels in order to attain proficiency. Courses are offered from the introductory level to the advanced and professional levels. Students not only develop their knowledge of the French language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the French-speaking world. They study cultures, communities, societies and literature in France and the Francophone world. The French language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Learning French will provide students with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in French will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main components of language study. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other people&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the French language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of French and Francophone cultures. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the French language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n\n<ol><li>to foster understanding of the experiences and world-views of French and Francophone cultures;</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies where French is spoken;</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis-a-vis French and Francophone societies and cultures;</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about French and Francophone societies, cultures, and the arts;</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This plan is available to students commencing at Advanced and Professional entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n",

You will not only develop your knowledge of the French language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the French-speaking world. You will study cultures, communities, societies and literature in France and the Francophone world. The French language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Learning French will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in French will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main components of language study. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other people&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the French language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of French and Francophone cultures. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is available to students commencing at Advanced and Professional entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>You will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found on the web at: <a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">hal.arts.unsw.edu.au</a></p>\n\n<p>You will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you.

Honours in Geography introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical and social environmental sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which includes a literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial an independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics within the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Honours in Geology introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the earth sciences and geosciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and an independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics in the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

This stream aims to prepare a graduate for a broad range of career opportunities in the various branches of Surveying and the numerous Spatial Information disciplines. To this end the stream covers general scientific and IT principles, as well as specialised Surveying and Spatial Information topics. Specialisation is provided for through the provision of elective courses offered in the third and fourth years of the program and the choice of a targeted final year thesis project often aligned with an external industry partner. <br /><br />The degree of BE in Surveying is recognised by the Board of Surveying and Spatial Information of New South Wales as meeting the requirements for entry as a candidate to become a Registered Surveyor. The degree is also recognised by the Institution of Surveyors, New South Wales, the Spatial Sciences Institute and Engineers Australia, for admission as corporate members.<br /><br />Suggestions for course sequences consistent with timetabling and availability can be found on the School website The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimize the student&#39;s choice of courses. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.<br /><br /></p>",

Through language study, you will acquire an understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which the Greek language is used and develop an understanding of Greece, its place in the world and its legacy in Australia.</p>\n\n<p>At UNSW, Modern Greek Studies combine the teaching of practical language skills with the study of history, society, culture and customs. You will gain knowledge and skills relevant to a wide range of career paths from business, trade and commerce to diplomacy, tourism and the media.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Introductory Greek courses are designed for students with little or no knowledge of Modern Greek. If you have prior knowledge you should contact the stream convenor for appropriate placement.</p>\n\n<p>Placement into senior level (MGRK2xxx) courses at the University of Sydney depends on your prior knowledge of the language.

If you successfully complete Greek courses cross-institutionally you will have your results reported as transfer credits at UNSW, that is, specific grades will not appear on your UNSW transcript.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a Commonwealth-supported student (domestic undergraduate student) in a UNSW program you will pay the student contribution amounts at the University of Sydney for each course. If you are an international student you will pay the corresponding tuition fees.</p>\n\n<p>You will be required to pay the Student Services and Amenities Fees (SSAF) at the University of Sydney. You may seek a refund for the corresponding UNSW fees if you are concurrently enrolled at UNSW.</p>\n\n<p>You are responsible for all travel and any ancillary or incidental costs or expenses.</p>\n\n<p>If you are undertaking cross-institutional study at the University of Sydney you are responsible for ensuring that all the requirements for your application are completed and submitted by the deadlines advertised.</p>\n\n<p>The cross-institutional arrangement with the University of Sydney is subject to annual review by both Universities. It may be discontinued or varied at any time at the Universities&#39; sole discretion.

Through language study, you will acquire an understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which the Italian language is used and develop an understanding of Italy, its place in the world and its legacy in Australia.</p>\n\n<p>At UNSW, Italian Studies combine the teaching of practical language skills with the study of history, society, culture and customs. You will gain knowledge and skills relevant to a wide range of career paths from business, trade and commerce to diplomacy, tourism and the media.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Introductory Italian courses are designed for students with little or no knowledge of Italian.

If you are an international student you need to pay the corresponding tuition fees.</p>\n\n<p>You will be required to pay the Student Services and Amenities Fees (SSAF) at the University of Sydney. You may seek a refund for the corresponding UNSW fees if you are concurrently enrolled at UNSW.</p>\n\n<p>You are responsible for all travel and any ancillary or incidental costs or expenses.</p>\n\n<p>In undertaking cross-institutionally study at the University of Sydney, you are responsible for ensuring that all the requirements for their application are completed and submitted by the deadlines advertised.</p>\n\n<p>The cross-institutional arrangement with the University of Sydney is subject to annual review by both Universities. It may be discontinued or varied at any time at the Universities\u2019 sole discretion.

Through provisions of Australia-Japan contact situations, students gain intercultural awareness and understanding, develop their knowledge of the language, cultures, societies and communities in Japan. The Japanese language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of Japan. Japan is of increasing fundamental importance to Australia for political, strategic and economic reasons in realisation of Australia in the Asian Century. Thus, learning Japanese and developing competence in Japanese will provide students a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in Japan and beyond, take an important role in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n\n<p>Aims of the Major</p>\n\n<p>There are two main components of Japanese Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of sociocultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Japanese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Japanese culture. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the Japanese language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n\n<ol><li>to foster an awareness of Japan&#39;s culture, history and society,</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies in Japan,</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis a vis Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate,</li><li>to nurture positive attitudes toward intercultural communication in general and with the Japanese,</li><li>to promote learner autonomy.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This stream is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For students admitted in their first year of study to ARTS2630 or higher on the grounds of ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of degree requirements.</p>\n",

The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of sociocultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Japanese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Japanese culture. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the Japanese language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n\n<ol><li>to foster an awareness of Japan&#39;s culture, history and society,</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies in Japan,</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis a vis Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate,</li><li>to nurture positive attitudes toward intercultural communication in general and with the Japanese,</li><li>to promote learner autonomy.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This stream is available to students commencing at Advanced and Professional entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n",

        "description": "The Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream is designed for students with a mechanical engineering major whose interests also lie in realising, commercialising and implementing mechanical and mechatronic systems and designs. The five core courses included as part of this stream have been designed on the basis of world best practice in manufacturing and industrial engineering and reflect a top-down - bottom-up approach, spanning the disciplines of Strategy and Management, Operations and Supply Chains, Analysis and Decision-making, Design of Product-Process Systems and Technology &amp; Automation.<br />\n<br />\nWithin each discipline area this new stream will cover many conceptual and analytical techniques, all supporting fact- and data-based analysis and decision making with the aim of improved product and process performance, economy and sustainability. This stream is designed to help you to learn how to transform a design from a conceptual stage into a prototype and ultimately into a commercially realisable and viable product. This stream focuses on technical as well as commercial aspects and particularly in developing the ability to build a business or commercial case for making engineering related decisions, such as investment in plant, equipment and processes. Although the main emphasis will be on product and process, consideration will also be given to designing compatible and appropriate engineering support services. The stream also emphasises the strategic impact of operations decisions and the interfaces between operations and the other functional areas of organisations, including of course, finance. This stream encompasses the key elements of operations management and investment analysis and pulls them together in a coherent format that allows you to understand the &#39;big picture&#39; as well as &#39;the specific details&#39;. It is aimed at integrating the knowledge gained from the mechanical engineering courses you have studied into a framework and process that allows you to implement your designs, solutions and ideas in a commercial environment.<br />\n<br />\nMechanical engineers have traditionally played the major role in the analysis and design of complex machinery, devices such as actuators and sensors, as well as energy transformation, heat transfer and electro-mechanical processes. In an environment of global competition, sustainability (energy, environment as well as cost and capital), increasingly complex customer requirements and statutory regulations as well as the increasing pace of technological change and new product innovation, it is vital for modern engineers to possess the skills to not only design but equally importantly, implement and realize their designs in the most appropriate way. In this increasingly complex environment, successful organizations - public, private or governmental - need engineers with analytical and diverse skills, especially in integrating technical with commercial and organisational issues, analyses and ultimately solutions. It is the purpose and aim of the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream to equip you with this knowledge and understanding to become a global engineer, indeed a leader, with the ability to apply analytical methods and quality processes to create short and long term value for your organization, your customers, and the community. It encapsulates the key elements of mechanical engineering and combines them with the five core disciplines of manufacturing and industrial engineering.<br />\n<br />\nAn engineer trained in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering may be employed in a very flexible and diverse range of disciplines and areas of industrial activity, including; product design, process design, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, quality improvement, technical and commercial analysis and decision making, strategic decision making, consulting, sales support, technical and organisational maintenance, and supply chain management.",

        "description": "<p>The School of Mathematics and Statistics (MathsStats) offers a number of Honours streams including in Quantitative Data Science. The Honours year introduces students to the investigative and research aspects of knowledge and consists of advanced lecture courses, an Honours thesis and seminar participation. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians.</p>\n\n<p>Students who enrol in the Quantitative Data Science\u00a0Honours Stream are expected to have completed\u00a0the\u00a0 Quantitative Data Science major in the Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions (program 3959), or one of the other majors in that program including at least three level 3 MATH courses. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0data science\u00a0may also apply for entry to this stream.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Quantitative Data Science can be completed full-time or part-time. Most students commence their enrolment in term 1\u00a0 but entry in term 3 is available subject to resources.\u00a0 Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stream structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>The thesis component of Quantitative Data Science\u00a0honours requires a student to undertake an 18uoc thesis by enrolling in the course MATH4001 (Mathematics and Statistics Honours Thesis) in each of three successive terms. These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time)\u00a0can complete the honours thesis\u00a0 in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also be required to participate in the weekly honours seminar, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. This seminar is intended to allow students to\u00a0practise their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities. Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff. The supervisor or supervisors of the thesis is expected to submit a report, but will not be a marker for the thesis. Students are required to give a short seminar on their thesis and this will account for 10% of the final mark for the thesis, the remaining 90% coming from the written thesis report.</p>\n\n<p>The 30uoc coursework component of Quantitative\u00a0Data Science\u00a0Honours will consist of five 6uoc lecture courses selected from the list below, or others, including at least 18UoC of\u00a0MATH courses, taken with the approval by the Head of School or nominee and the advice of the honours thesis supervisor.</p>\n\n<ul></ul>\n",

We offer expert supervision across a wide range of areas in modern mathematics and statistics. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians and statisticians.<br />\nStudents who enrol in the Statistics Honours Stream are expected to have completed a statistics or mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0statistics may also apply for entry to this stream.<br />\nHonours in Statistics\u00a0can be completed full-time or part-time.

Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entry Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>So that students have sufficient background to attempt the courses in the honours year, students must discuss their selection of Level III courses with the\u00a0Statistics Honours Coordinator or another academic adviser.</p>\n\n<p>To enter honours in Statistics, students must have</p>\n\n<ul><li>Completed a Statistics major in the Science or Advanced Science program <strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of the Advanced Statistics plans in the Advanced Mathematics degree <strong>or</strong>;</li><li>Completed a suitable mathematics or statistics degree at another university.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>In addition</em>, students will normally be required to have:</p>\n\n<ul><li>An average above 70 in their level III mathematics courses <strong>and</strong></li><li>An average above 70 in level III statistics courses.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The level III statistics courses at UNSW are those courses numbered from MATH3800 to MATH3999 inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>With the permission of the Head of School (or nominee), a student may be allowed into Statistics\u00a0Honours without having satisfied the specific departmental requirements, and instead have shown some evidence of the ability to undertake independent study.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>The discipline of mathematics at UNSW is divided into several areas of study: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pure Mathematics</em> is the study of the essential structures of mathematics. Work by pure mathematicians underpins most of the technological advances of this century. Pure Mathematics is concerned with problems and techniques which transcend specific applications. Research, focusing on the development of existing theories or the creation of new ones, may be driven by applications or by the internal demands of the discipline. Pure Mathematics courses provide the insights and understanding required by those using mathematics, leading to mastery of the fundamental processes of mathematical science and the capacity for innovative applications in any area.</p>\n\n<p><em>Applied Mathematics</em> concerns the development of mathematics and models for understanding scientific phenomena, for the solution of technical and industrial problems, and for use in the social, economic and management sciences. Courses are designed to provide basic mathematical and computational skills needed for a wide range of applications, to develop the capability to construct, analyse and interpret mathematical models, and to encourage enthusiasm for the role of the mathematician in a variety of contexts.</p>\n\n<p><em>Statistics</em> is the science and art of using factual material for modelling and inference. Its mathematical foundations are in the theory of probability and it deals with how to estimate and make decisions using knowledge which is uncertain or observational material which is subject to error. There is a rich interplay of ideas between the theory of statistics and fields such as engineering, medicine and biological and behavioural sciences where statistical problems constantly arise.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for a major in Mathematics for Education as part of a concurrent Bachelor of Science / Bachelor of Education program (4076). Only students enrolled concurrently in both a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Education program may take this major. The major ensures that students meet all accreditation requirements with the NSW Institute of Teachers.</p>\n",

Students in Materials Science Honours undertake a supervised research project (<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2020/MATS4505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MATS4505 Materials Science Honours Project</a> (12UOC) over three terms)\u00a0that places emphasis on the development of advanced disciplinary knowledge, the use of scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques relevant to the chosen research area, practice of critical thinking, synthesis and analysis of information and data, and scientific research communication in both written and oral forms.</p>\n\n<p>The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning Honours in Materials Science is that students take on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these knowledge and skills with some degree of independence. Students are expected to formulate their project rationale, objectives, literature survey, and project management plan, done formally in <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/MATS4504.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MATS4504 Research Training</a> (6UOC), then undertake and complete the work in a timely manner over one term. In most cases the project will involve substantial experimental work and this is usually done within established research groups in the School as well as in collaboration with other groups in the University and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The principal form of teaching is based on research supervision and direction by specialist researchers within the School of Materials Science and Engineering. Complementing this, students must complete <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/MATS4503.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MATS4503 Professional Skills</a> (6UOC) which includes formal training in professional communication, writing skills, project planning, data analysis, intellectual property, and risk management and workplace safety.</p>\n\n<p>Learning outcomes from this Honours stream will form the basis for future pursuits in materials science research but are also highly relevant for many other professions - both within the materials industry, but also in many other related yet diverse fields.</p>\n\n<p>The School offers a wide variety of student research projects in the Materials Science discipline including topics on synthesis and production of advanced materials, materials recycling, functional materials, sustainable materials, advanced surface coatings, electrical materials, biomedical materials, physical metallurgy, process metallurgy, etc. Most students would complete Honours as full-time students, where the program is completed over three consecutive terms. Part-time study is also possible depending on availability of supervision and suitable projects. Most students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (February) but Term 3 (September) entry\u00a0is available. Students should check the <a href=\"http://www.materials.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">Materials Science website</a> for current enrolment deadlines, and assessment and completion dates.</p>\n",

These fascinating organisms impact on our lives in many ways. On the negative side, they cause disease in humans, animals and plants, and they spoil our food. However, microorganisms are also of great benefit. Indeed, microorganisms are the key participants for the turnover of nutrients and elements and they are the main producers of carbon and biomass. They turn the biological wheels on this globe and are responsible for sustainability of life. They also contribute to a better environment via recycling of organic wastes, maintenance of soil fertility and biodegradation of pollutants. Many foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals and other products of biotechnology are products of microbial action. The genetic engineering of microorganisms is a fundamental aspect of molecular biology and the way of the future.",

        "description": "Microbiology is the scientific study of the smallest forms of life namely, bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi and protozoa. These fascinating organisms impact on our lives in many ways. On the negative side, they cause disease in humans, animals and plants, and they spoil our food. However, microorganisms are also of great benefit. Indeed, microorganisms are the key participants for the turnover of nutrients and elements and they are the main producers of carbon and biomass. They turn the biological wheels on this globe and are responsible for sustainability of life. They also contribute to a better environment via recycling of organic wastes, maintenance of soil fertility and biodegradation of pollutants. Many foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals and other products of biotechnology are products of microbial action. The genetic engineering of microorganisms is a fundamental aspect of molecular biology and the way of the future.",

UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Process</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors.

Year 3 is largely devoted to fundamental courses in mining engineering while Year 4 provides advanced instruction in aspects essential for all mining engineers. Elective courses are offered in both Year 3 and Year 4 of the stream.</p>\n\n<p>An important requirement in the fourth year is for students to undertake personal research or a study project in mining or minerals engineering for which they are required to submit a dissertation for examination. After graduation, mining engineers who choose to develop careers in operations management gain further practical experience to obtain a Mine Manager&#39;s Certificate of Competency, in either Coal or Metalliferous Mining. Formal arrangements are in place with the University of Newcastle for students who have completed a specified program to be admitted with advanced standing to Year 3 of the program at UNSW.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stream Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>The stream structure shown indicates one sequence of courses that fulfils the requirements of the stream rules.</p>\n\n<p>As the stream structure indicates, a number of course electives are offered each term in Year 3 and Year 4.

Honours in Marine Science introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical, environmental and ecological sciences with an emphasis on marine, aquatic and coastal environments. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three terms, includes a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and partly independent Research Project. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines or programs at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Admission Process</strong></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Marine Science stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline. <strong>Please note:</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program receive some Advanced Standing in <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">8623 Masters of Environmental Management</a> and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

A large component of MCP is re-conceptualising performance and performance-making in creative, bold and imaginative ways. You will develop projects that break away with established traditions, looking to explore and develop your own unique creative voice and artistic identity that reflect the diverse artistic practices of the 21st century. Curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic courage, willingness to step outside your comfort zone, and commitment to exploring perspectives and approaches other than your own are all fundamental to succeeding in this stream.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The stream is structured around three core courses. The gateway course,\u00a0<strong>Music Performance Styles and Interpretation</strong>, develops specialised knowledge of a range of music styles including those derived from particular historical periods, genres and approaches to music interpretation. The course will help students to develop a stylistically informed performance with careful consideration of relevant technical and interpretative issues.\u00a0<strong>Creative Projects in Performance and Composition</strong>\u00a0is aimed at enhancing performance and presentation skills through collaborative projects between musicians, between musicians and composers, and between musicians and members of production teams.\u00a0<strong>Music Analysis</strong>\u00a0examines and applies a range of strategies for analyzing a broad range of music. Each strategy will begin with a problem: of technique, of experience, of description. Dedicated forums in the\u00a0<strong>Performance Laboratory</strong>\u00a0course provide a space for instructional learning in private and group situations, for observational and experiential learning in workshops and formal performance settings, and for experimental learning in environments that emphasize the development of creativity and individuality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Music Creative Practice</strong>\u00a0also enables students to develop excellence in a comprehensive range of ensemble practices, in other theoretical and critical subjects, in music from various styles, genres and cultures as preparation for professional work in music performance, arranging and composition, music teaching, practice-based research, broadcasting and recording, music journalism, and arts administration. Graduates may also pursue further qualifications in music education.</p>\n\n<p>The Music Creative Practice Stream is one of four streams within the Bachelor of Music (UNSW BMus) four-year, full time degree.</p>\n\n<p>Students wishing to enter this stream will be assessed for eligibility after the completion of MUSC1707 Performance Laboratory A \u00a0by a panel chosen by the Program Authority.</p>\n\n<p>1.

The gateway course, <strong>Music Performance Styles and Interpretation</strong>, develops specialised knowledge of a range of music styles including those derived from particular historical periods, genres and approaches to music interpretation. The course will help students to develop a stylistically informed performance with careful consideration of relevant technical and interpretative issues. <strong>Creative Projects in Performance and Composition</strong> is aimed at enhancing performance and presentation skills through collaborative projects between musicians, between musicians and composers, and between musicians and members of production teams. <strong>Music Analysis</strong> examines and applies a range of strategies for analyzing a broad range of music. Each strategy will begin with a problem: of technique, of experience, of description. Dedicated forums in the <strong>Performance Laboratory</strong> course provide a space for instructional learning in private and group situations, for observational and experiential learning in workshops and formal performance settings, and for experimental learning in environments that emphasize the development of creativity and individuality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Music Creative Practice</strong> also enables students to develop excellence in a comprehensive range of ensemble practices, in other theoretical and critical subjects, in music from various styles, genres and cultures as preparation for professional work in music performance, arranging and composition, music teaching, practice-based research, broadcasting and recording, music journalism, and arts administration. Graduates may also pursue further qualifications in music education.</p>\n\n<p>The Music Creative Practice Stream is one of four streams within the Bachelor of Music (UNSW BMus) four-year, full time degree.</p>\n\n<p>Students wishing to enter this stream will be selected at the end of semester one in the second year of study in the single degree or third year of study in the dual degree by a panel chosen by the Program Authority.

Students become familiar with examining both macroscopic specimens and the microscopic differences between normal and abnormal cells, tissues and organs. In modern teaching facilities, much of the study of microscopic abnormalities is undertaken using computer-based \u201cvirtual\u201d microscopy. Courses offered in Pathology allow in-depth study of many fascinating and important disorders such as meningitis, tuberculosis, auto-immune diseases, congenital diseases, a variety of cancers, HIV/AIDS, heart disease, asthma, musculoskeletal diseases and the human version of &#39;mad cow disease&#39;.</p>",

More specifically, it considers how molecules in cells interact to provide specific functions (molecular and cellular physiology) and how organs, which are collections of cell types, have local and distant actions via neural and humoral communication to sustain the life of an organism (systems and integrative physiology). Physiology contributes to all major aspects of human biology and the allied disciplines of pharmacology, anatomy and pathology.<br />\n<br />\nA major in Medical Physiology is only available to students enrolled in the Bachelor of Medical Science program.",

It requires studying higher-level coursework and completion of an independent research project, under the guidance of an academic supervisor. The Honours year commences in Term 1 and is undertaken full-time over 1 year. Term 3 entry may also be available. Part-time enrolment, commencing Term 1 only, may be available.</p>\n\n<p>Students complete 24 UOC of coursework by enrolling in PHYS4141 Quantum Mechanics (Honours) 6 UOC and PHYS4142 Statistical Physics (Honours) 6 UOC in Term 1, and PHYS4143 Topics in Contemporary Physics 12 UOC in Term 2. The Term 1 courses are assessed via assignments worth 40% and exams worth 60% of the final mark. In PHYS4143 students will take two of the four lecture modules offered in modern physics. These are assessed via a presentation (10%), assignments (30%) and final exam (60%). Coursework contributes 50% towards a student\u2019s final grade for honours.</p>\n\n<p>The other 50% of a Physics honours mark comes from completion of an original research project, conducted over three terms. Students complete 24 UOC of research by enrolling in PHYS4144 Physics Honours Research A 6 UOC in Term 1, PHYS4145 Physics Honours Research B 6 UOC in Term 2 and PHYS4146 Physics Honours Research C 12 UOC in Term 3. Projects are offered in all areas of research in the School: Astrophysics; Biophysics; Condensed Matter Physics; Music Acoustics and Theoretical Physics. Projects are also offered by academics in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology. A list of projects and supervisors will be available in the term before students begin honours.\u00a0Students are assessed by submission of a research proposal, literature review, and final thesis. The research proposal is worth 10%, the literature review contributes 20% and the thesis contributes 70% to the final research mark. These will be marked by two assessors within the School, one of whom will be the student&#39;s supervisor. Students are required to give a short talk about their research at the end of the year, but this is not assessable.</p>\n",

Details of thesis requirements such as word limit, format, and submission deadline will be provided by the School.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of a student\u2019s first and second terms, an EC grade will be awarded for each course (PSYC4072 and PSYC4093 in Term 1, PSYC4073 and PSYC4103 in Term 2) provided that all requirements for the term have been satisfactorily completed, and the supervisor is satisfied with a student\u2019s progress on their project.</p>\n\n<p>Where term requirements have not been completed or the supervisor feels progress on the student&#39;s project is unsatisfactory, the grade will be withheld and the student given an opportunity to complete the requirement and / or progress their project. If the outstanding requirement(s) has not been completed prior to the commencement of the following term, the supervisor will discuss this with the Honours Coordinators and the student may be required to withdraw from the program. Once withdrawn from the program, a student will need to reapply for admission to the Honours Program.</p>\n\n<p>Once the Honours year is completed, a student&#39;s Final Mark (see Honours Grade Calculation, below) will be recorded against all courses across the whole year (i.e., EC grades replaced with the overall Honours mark).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Academic Rules</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>Students are expected to complete all the requirements for Honours as listed in this page of the Handbook. Where a student does not complete a particular requirement of Honours, their grade and hence graduation will be withheld until the item is completed.</li><li>Students must abide by UNSW policies and procedures with regards to Work Health &amp; Safety, Ethics, and Research. Details of these will be provided to students in an Honours Handbook and information session by the School.</li><li>Students will complete a research project totalling 30 UOC. Each student will have a supervisor for their project who is expected to have at least a Masters (AQF level 9) qualification.</li><li>Students may be supervised by a person external to UNSW, especially where a research project is industry-based. However, where a student has an external supervisor a joint-supervisor must be nominated who is an employed academic of the School.</li><li>It is not possible to take leave from the Honours program.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Honours Grade Calculation</strong></p>\n\n<p>In calculating an overall Honours mark, assessment components are given the following weight:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Research project component [PSYC4072 Honours Research Project 6 UOC, PSYC4073 Honours Research Project 12 UOC (Term 2), PSYC4073 Honours Research Project 12 UOC (Term 3)]\u00a0- 62.5%</li><li>Coursework component (PSYC4093 Psychology 4A &amp; PSYC4103 Psychology 4B) - 37.5%</li></ul>\n\n<p>At the completion of Honours, students will be awarded an honours grading as follows:</p>\n\n<p><em>Final Mark \u226585 (Honours Class 1)</em><br />\n<em>Final Mark 75-84 (Honours Class 2.1)</em><br />\n<em>Final Mark 65-74 (Honours Class 2.2)</em><br />\n<em>Final Mark 50-64 (Honours Class 3)</em></p>\n\n<p>The calculation of class of award will be determined from the student\u2019s weighted average mark for all of the courses (research-based and coursework) required for the program.</p>\n\n<p>Note that only PSYC4XXX coded courses will be used to calculate the honours grading.</p>\n\n<p>Honours marks and gradings will be scrutinised at the School level to ensure consistency across cohorts. The Faculty will also review these marks and grades prior to the release of results.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>This Honours in Psychology stream is the honours pathway for students who have completed an APAC-accredited Psychology major in a pass degree at UNSW, or equivalent at another recognised institution.</p>\n\n<p>UNSW students will not be allowed entry into this Honours stream unless they have achieved an average mark of 75\u00a0or higher of:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Marks for <em><strong>60 UOC of psychology core courses</strong></em> (those common to all programs*); and</li><li>The <em><strong>three highest</strong></em> of marks for all Level 3 psychology elective courses\u00a0ever attempted (i.e., a total of 18 UOC).</li></ul>\n\n<p>* The 60 UOC of psychology core courses are:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Level 1:\u00a0PSYC1001, PSYC1011, PSYC1111</li><li>Level 2:\u00a0PSYC2001, PSYC2061, PSYC2071, PSYC2081, PSYC2101</li><li>Level 3:\u00a0PSYC3001 and PSYC3011</li></ul>\n\n<p>This &#34;Psychology Average&#34; is based on a student\u2019s mark for the first attempt at each course\u2014unless there were special circumstances which justify including the mark from the second attempt. In such cases, students should set out these circumstances in a letter to the Honours Coordinators at the time of application. Results for psychology courses completed externally (i.e., at another institution) are not included in the Psychology Average.</p>\n\n<p>Exceptional graduates from other institutions may apply for Honours in psychology via program <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/programs/current/4518.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">4518 Bachelor of Psychological Science</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Process</strong></p>\n\n<p>UNSW students who wish to undertake Honours in psychology should familiarise themselves with the School&#39;s list of available supervisors and their research interests. The School may run an Honours information session in approximately August or September, at which time the list and other information about the Honours year will be made available. If the session does not go ahead, students will be able to access the information from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.psy.unsw.edu.au/current-students/undergraduate/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of Psychology website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All UNSW students must submit an online Intention to Undertake Honours Form - this is how supervisor preferences are recorded. Students not enrolled in a program in which the Honours year is embedded (e.g., 3435 Bachelor of Psychological Science, 3970 Bachelor of Science) must also submit an <a href=\"https://applyonline.unsw.edu.au/login\" rel=\"nofollow\">online application for admission</a> for the separate program, 4518 Bachelor of Psychological Science.</p>\n\n<p>Exceptional graduates from other institutions need only submit an <a href=\"https://applyonline.unsw.edu.au/login\" rel=\"nofollow\">online application for admission</a> for the separate program, 4518 Bachelor of Psychological Science, as their supervisor preferences will be managed separately.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in psychology is only available for commencement in Term 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Postgraduate Study</em></p>\n\n<p>An Honours degree is required for entry to most postgraduate psychology programs in Australian universities.</p>\n\n<p><em>Registration as a Psychologist and APS Membership</em></p>\n\n<p>The Honours year in psychology at UNSW is an APAC-accredited fourth-year sequence, leading to provisional registration as a psychologist (<a href=\"http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.psychologyboard.gov.au</a>) and associate membership of the <a href=\"http://www.psychology.org.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australian Psychological Society (APS)</a>.</p>\n",

From 2006 onwards we have seen an explosion of interest in the School&#39;s technologies from major industry players all around the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second Area of Specialisation</strong></p>\n\n<p>The cross-disciplinary nature of photovoltaics and renewable energy applications necessitates many PV engineers possessing broad engineering backgrounds or else working in teams with other engineers. A good example is the UNSW Solar Car Project involving PV engineers, electronics engineers, control engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, power engineers, biomedical engineers, computer engineers, and communication engineers. Therefore it is important for photovoltaic engineers to have a broader understanding of other engineering disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>A unique feature of this stream is that in Year 2, students have the opportunity to select a strand to complement their education in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy. Each strand comprises 18 units of credit with the opportunity to subsequently select additional electives in the corresponding area in the final two years, subject to the approval of the Undergraduate Coordinator. The strands available are listed below and cover areas such as computing, electronics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, physics, chemical engineering, and architecture. Students may also formulate their own strands subject to the approval of the Undergraduate Coordinator.</p>\n\n<p>Selection of a second area of specialisation is subject to the stream rule that states that no more than 60 UOC of first-year level courses may be counted toward the BE (Hons) in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy.</p>\n\n<p>Photovoltaics and Solar Energy is also available as a component of the dual degree programs.</p>\n",
