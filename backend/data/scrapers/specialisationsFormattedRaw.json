The Advanced Chinese Studies major specialisation at UNSW encompasses the study of Chinese language and communication as well as culture, society and civilisation, including Chinese literature, cinema, history, politics and philosophy. A background in Chinese Studies is useful in many areas of professional specialisation, from commerce and the business sector to tourism, the media, the public service sector and education.<br /><br />There are two main components of Chinese Studies. The first is a focus on acquiring / enhancing competence in the Chinese language. Language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of socio-cultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending others\u2019 expression, both oral and written. The ability to read written texts is an important part of this. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Chinese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform an understanding of Chinese culture. These disciplines include literary, cultural, film, translation, gender, and media studies as well as anthropological, linguistic, historical and sociological approaches.<br /><br />This specialisation is available to students commencing at Advanced, Professional and Expert entry levels.</p>",

You can enter Chinese language courses at different levels, depending on your knowledge of Chinese characters. Within each year, you are allocated to different groups, depending on your speaking ability.<br /><br />If you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found on the web at: <a href=\"https://www.unsw.edu.au/arts-design-architecture/our-schools/humanities-languages/student-life/resources-support/language-placementshttps://www.unsw.edu.au/arts-design-architecture/our-schools/humanities-languages/student-life/resources-support/language-placements\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of Humanities and Languages - Language Placements</a><br /><br />You will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you in terms of Chinese character knowledge. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.<br /><br />If you are admitted in your first year of study to ARTS2450 or higher on the grounds of your ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of your degree requirements.<br /><br />You will be admitted to the Expert level of entry to the Major if you have completed high school in China or have elsewhere achieved equivalent language proficiency to a Chinese high school graduate. This level emphasises Chinese Studies (contextual and professional) courses. Since you already have a high level of language proficiency and literacy in Chinese, you will enroll in Translation and Interpreting courses as Gateway language courses \u2013 which are a requirement for the major at this entry level.</p>",

However, anatomy today is much more than the descriptive study of the dissected body, although dissected specimens are still used for research and instruction. The study of anatomy now embraces separate but strongly related disciplines: gross anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply; histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells; embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations; neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord; biological anthropology involves applying biological principles and approaches to the study of humans &amp; non-human primates.</p>\n<p>UNSW is highly ranked in Anatomy and Physiology. At UNSW, all anatomy courses have a strong emphasis on living anatomy with functional and clinical significance of the structures in health and in disease. Anatomy is also applied to related disciplines of biomedical engineering, medical imaging and diagnostic technology, and the virtual and augmented reality.</p>\n<p>Careers in anatomy include medicine, medical research, neuroscience, reproductive technologies (IVF) and allied health disciplines such as Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology. You could pursue a career as a radiographer, forensic anthropologist, immersive (VR, AR) developer, and a data specialist. Studying anatomy also prepares students for careers in medicine and is especially relevant clinical skills, surgery and radiological imaging.</p>\n<p>Anatomy may be combined with elective courses in Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, Pathology or Psychology.</p>",

However, anatomy today is much more than the descriptive study of the dissected body, although dissected specimens, along with immersive technologies such as virtual reality, are used for research and instruction. The study of anatomy now embraces separate but strongly related disciplines: gross anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply; histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells; embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations; neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord; biological anthropology involves applying biological principles and approaches to the study of humans &amp; non-human primates.</p>\n<p>At UNSW, all anatomy courses have a strong emphasis on living anatomy with functional and clinical significance of the structures in health and in disease. Anatomy is also applied to related disciplines of biomedical engineering, medical imaging and diagnostic technology, and the virtual and augmented reality.</p>\n<p>Careers in anatomy include medicine, medical research, neuroscience, reproductive technologies (IVF) and allied health disciplines such as Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology.

The Honours year introduces students to the investigative and research aspects of knowledge and consists of advanced lecture courses, an Honours thesis and seminar participation. We offer expert supervision across a wide range of areas in modern mathematics and statistics. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians.<br />\nStudents who enrol in the Applied Mathematics Honours Stream are expected to have completed a mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0applied mathematics may also apply for entry to this stream.<br />\nHonours in Applied Mathematics can be completed full-time or part-time. Most students commence their enrolment in term 1\u00a0 but entry in term 3 is available subject to resources. Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entry Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>So that students have sufficient background to attempt the courses in the honours year, students must discuss their selection of Level III courses with the Applied Mathematics Honours Coordinator or another academic adviser.<br />\nTo enter honours in applied mathematics, students must have</p>\n\n<ul><li>Completed the mathematics or physical oceanography\u00a0stream in the Science or Advanced Science program, including at least 30 units of credit in Level III mathematics or statistics of which at least 18uoc must be in level III applied mathematics,\u00a0<strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of\u00a0 the applied mathematics\u00a0stream in the Advanced Mathematics degree\u00a0<strong>or;</strong></li><li>Completed a suitable mathematics or statistics degree at another university.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>In addition,</em>\u00a0students will normally be required to have:</p>\n\n<ul><li>An average above 70 in their level III mathematics or statistics courses\u00a0<strong>and</strong></li><li>An average above 70 in level III applied mathematics courses.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The level III applied mathematics courses at UNSW are those courses numbered from MATH3010 to MATH3399 inclusive.<br />\nWith the permission of the Head of School (or nominee), a student may be allowed into Applied Mathematics Honours without having satisfied the specific departmental requirements, and instead have shown some evidence of the ability to undertake independent study.</p>\n",

        "additional_info": "<p>The thesis component of applied mathematics honours requires a student to undertake an 18uoc thesis by enrolling in the course MATH4001 (Mathematics and Statistics Honours Thesis) in each of three successive terms. These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time)\u00a0can complete the honours thesis\u00a0 in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also be required to participate in the weekly honours seminar, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. This seminar is intended to allow students to\u00a0practise their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities.\u00a0Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff. The supervisor or supervisors of the thesis is expected to submit a report, but will not be a marker for the thesis. Students are required to give a short seminar on their thesis and this will account for 10% of the final mark for the thesis, the remaining 90% coming from the written thesis report.</p>\n\n<p>The 30uoc coursework component of applied mathematics honours will consist of five 6uoc lecture courses at honours/postgraduate level (typically MATH5xxx courses).\u00a0 The suite of courses must be approved by the Head of School or nominee and taken with the advice of the honours thesis supervisor. A student may be permitted to take one or, exceptionally, at most two, courses from outside the School of MathsStats, for example at the AMSI summer school, at another institution or at another UNSW academic unit.</p>\n\n<p>The marks for the thesis and other honours courses will be combined to give a weighted average mark forming a final honours mark which will be rounded up and used to decide the grade of honours the student will be awarded as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Honours class 1 -- final mark of 85 or over</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 1 -- final mark from 75 to 84</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 2 -- final mark from 65 to 74</li><li>Honours class 3 -- final mark from 50 to 64</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who successfully complete Mathematics or Statistics Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by applying to undertake postgraduate studies by PhD or Masters. Students with successful honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW. Students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.

Students undertake a supervised research project in an area of research significance as approved by the Head of School. The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program. A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Bioinformatics can be found at <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Bioinformatics is to be completed full-time. Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516\u00a0School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about staff research interests and the process of applying for Honours can be found <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours-mphil-babs\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS webpage</a>. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from School of BABS webpage:<a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\"> www.babs.unsw.edu.au</a></p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Bioinformatics may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Bioinformatics have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>The School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences (BEES) offers a number of Honours streams including in Biology. Honours in Biology introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the biological sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a a Research Proposal (which may include an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and independent Research Project conducted under the close supervision of academic(s) within The School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>\n",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Biology must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Biology (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours Program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Biology stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline: <strong>Please note:</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Biology receive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc) and in the public sector (Local, State or Federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Biotechnology can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Biotechnology is to be completed full-time.\u00a0Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with the undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516 BABS Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about the process of applying for Honours can be found here <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours</a>, and other appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Biotechnology may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Biotechnology have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n",

Product engineers work on the fluids that you use in your everyday life, including chemicals (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, shampoos, paints, glues), foods, and drinks. As a product engineer, you will learn to take consumer needs and turn them into technical requirements, finding the right combinations of chemicals to deliver those properties and then developing the product and strategies for commercialisation and manufacture. You will learn how to apply your knowledge of engineering and chemistry to design complex chemical products for the pharmaceutical, consumer products and food industries. You&#39;ll master the entire development process, testing out ideas for products and extrapolating small scale, laboratory chemistry into large, industrial scale production. In the final year Product Design Project, you will work with industry partners to develop a new consumer product up to the point where it could be patented and commercialised. To get work ready, you&#39;ll apply these skills through 60 days of approved industry training.<br /><br />The courses listed below have to be completed to finish the degree, but the order in which they are taken is important and you need to follow advice on this. Many courses are offered only once per year and others have pre-requisites or exclusions which govern the order in which they can be taken. Both of these things can have a big impact on enrolment planning if poor choices of course combinations are made. You are strongly encouraged to consult the School website and follow the recommended course sequence linked <a href=\"https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/study-with-us/undergraduate-degrees/chemical-product-engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br /><br />The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimise your choice of courses. It is your responsibility to plan your enrolment appropriately. Assistance is available from Engineering Student Support Services, should you require it.</p>",

As such, many fields of science involve an understanding and/or application of chemistry or materials derived from chemical processes. Since the mid-20th century six notable Australians have won Nobel prizes for their contributions to science , which involved significant aspects of chemistry. These include Sir John Cornforth; and for Medicine with a substantial chemistry component - Florey (1945), - MacFarlane Burnett (1960), - Eccles (1963), - Doherty (1996) and - Blackburn (2009). W.H. Bragg, W.L Bragg won the prize in Physics (1915), which led to major advances in chemistry, biology and material science.</p>\n<p>Chemistry has prominence in the modern world via applications involving nanotechnologies and popular compact electronic devices of everyday use. However, there are many more chemical uses that that support modern society and occupy many roles without being noticed or even pondered.</p>\n<p>Chemistry is science at the molecular level. Chemical science underpins defence technology at every level from lasers and high-speed computers to food science and energetic materials. Ordnance and Engineering are particular areas where UNSW Canberra Chemistry majors have found employment.</p>\n<p>Chemistry is divided into several sub-fields. The School of Science has strengths in Physical and Theoretical Chemistry as well as Inorganic and Organic Chemistry. Within each of these sub-fields there are specialist fields of laser spectroscopy, biological chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, explosives and molecular design. As well as teaching, academic staff carry out research in these fields. Fourth year Honours and higher degree by research (MSc, PhD) programs are available within a range of specified areas.</p>",

Students in Chemistry Honours undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations.<br /><br />The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning Chemistry Honours is centred on students taking on their &#39;role as a researcher&#39; to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge, with some degree of independence.<br /><br />In addition to the research project, Chemistry Honours includes formal coursework and requires attendance at School seminars, aimed at broadening a graduate&#39;s knowledge. Most students would complete Honours as full-time students, where the program is completed over three consecutive trimesters. Part-time study is also possible depending on availability of supervision and suitable projects and this can be undertaken between four to six trimesters.<br /><br />Student research projects are available across the full range of Chemistry disciplines, with a focus on our School\u2019s major research themes of Catalysis and Energy, Nanoscience, and Medicinal Chemistry. Further information on the Honours program and the School\u2019s research can be found on the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chemistry.unsw.edu.au/current-students/undergraduate/honours-research\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chemistry Honours</a>\u00a0page and the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chemistry.unsw.edu.au/research/research-themes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chemistry Research Themes</a>\u00a0page.<br /><br />Most students commence their enrolment in a trimester (commonly T1 and T3). Students are expected to commence work on their project in Week 1 of their first trimester. Honours typically runs until mid-November (T1 commencement) or end of their final trimester. Students should check the Chemistry Honours webpages for current enrolment deadlines, and assessment and completion dates.<br /><br />The Chemistry Honours stream involves undertaking a research project that, although conducted under supervision, contains substantial independent research and self-direction. The research project is described in a submitted Project Thesis that forms the largest component of the assessment. The Project Thesis is complemented by introductory proposal and oral, School-wide seminar about the research project, and an oral examination (viva voce). Students are also required to attend compulsory Workplace Health and Safety training, relevant inductions, as well as School seminars.<br /><br />The Chemistry Honours stream also contains an advanced coursework component. Students elect to study a series of advanced topics covering a broad range of chemistry.</p>",

Exceptions to these requirements will only be permitted with the consent of the Head of School or nominee (Honours Coordinator). External students should provide evidence of equivalent study and will require approval of the Head of School or nominee (Honours Coordinator).<br /><br />Other requirements for entry to Honours in Chemistry are as shown below:<br />A credit average (&#61;65% WAM) for all undergraduate Science courses.<br />A credit average for all Level II and III courses in the Chemistry major.<br />An applicant with an overall WAM of between 60 to 64 will require the permission of the Head of School to enrol in Honours in Chemistry.<br />Admission Process<br /><br />Students who meet the entry requirements should make contact with potential supervisors aligning with their interests and discuss undertaking Honours with them. Potential students should then apply for acceptance into the stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the Chemistry Honours page. Students accepted into the program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.<br /><br />Supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the Chemistry Honours page. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via the Chemistry Research page.<br />Pathways<br />Students who successfully complete Chemistry Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students with successful Honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW. Students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies. Further information can be obtained from the postgraduate studies page.<br /><br />Graduates of Chemistry Honours are well qualified to work in any Chemistry or associated research laboratory as a Research Assistant or Research Technician. Graduates may also find employment in the public or private sectors either using their chemistry skills directly, or alternatively in a range of other fields using the analytical and research skills developed during the Honours year. For more information see the School of Chemistry\u2019s Careers page.<br /><br />Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought.</p>",

Inclusion of advanced level studies from more than one field of specialisation results in a broadly based degree in the chemical sciences. For example, a combination of Chemistry and Biochemistry leads to further work in areas such as toxicology and neurochemistry. Combining Level III Chemistry with Mathematics provides a valuable basis for the many applications of computers in Chemistry.

Since the mid-20th century six notable Australians have won Nobel prizes for their contributions to science, which involved significant aspects of chemistry. These include Sir John Cornforth; and for Medicine with a substantial chemistry component - Florey (1945), - MacFarlane Burnett (1960), - Eccles (1963), - Doherty (1996) and - Blackburn (2009). W.H. Bragg, W.L Bragg won the prize in Physics (1915), which led to major advances in chemistry, biology and material science.</p>\n<p>Chemistry has prominence in the modern world via applications involving nanotechnologies and popular compact electronic devices of everyday use. However, there are many more chemical uses that that support modern society and occupy many roles without being noticed or even pondered.</p>\n<p>Chemistry is science at the molecular level. Chemical science underpins defence technology at every level from lasers and high-speed computers to food science and energetic materials. Ordnance and Engineering are particular areas where UNSW Canberra Chemistry majors have found employment.</p>\n<p>Chemistry is divided into several sub-fields. The School of Science has strengths in Physical and Theoretical Chemistry as well as Inorganic and Organic Chemistry. Within each of these sub-fields there are specialist fields of laser spectroscopy, biological chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, explosives and molecular design. As well as teaching, academic staff carry out research in these fields. Fourth year Honours and higher degree by research (MSc, PhD) programs are available within a range of specified areas.</p>",

Inclusion of advanced level studies from more than one field of specialisation results in a broadly based degree in the chemical sciences. For example, a combination of Chemistry and Biochemistry leads to further work in areas such as toxicology and neurochemistry. Combining Level III Chemistry with Mathematics provides a valuable basis for the many applications of computers in Chemistry. Chemistry with Physics or Materials Science allows entry into the rapidly developing field of advanced materials.",

The Chinese Studies major at UNSW encompasses the study of Chinese language and communication as well as culture, society and civilisation, including Chinese literature, cinema, history, politics and philosophy. A background in Chinese Studies is useful in many areas of professional specialisation, from commerce and the business sector to tourism, the media, the public service sector and education.<br /><br />There are two main components of Chinese Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the Chinese language. Acquiring language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of socio-cultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending others\u2019 expression, both oral and written. The ability to read written texts is an important part of this process. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Chinese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform an understanding of Chinese culture. These disciplines include literary, cultural, film, translation, gender, and media studies as well as anthropological, linguistic, historical and sociological approaches.<br /><br />This specialisation is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>",

You can enter Chinese language courses at different levels, depending on your knowledge of Chinese characters. Within each year, you are allocated to different groups, depending on your speaking ability.<br /><br />If you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found on the web at:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.unsw.edu.au/arts-design-architecture/our-schools/humanities-languages/student-life/resources-support/language-placements\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of Humanities and Languages - Language Placements</a><br /><br />You will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you in terms of Chinese character knowledge. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.<br /><br />If you are admitted in your first year of study to ARTS2450 or higher on the grounds of your ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of your degree requirements.</p>",

Honours in Climate Science introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in climate dynamics, global climate change, and extremes of weather and climate. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include a literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial\u00a0 independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics in the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible for students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.<br /><br />Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.<br /><br />Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.<br /><br /><em>Admission Process</em><br /><br />Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Climate Science stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the BEES Honours Program webpage (<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours</a>). It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via UNSW Research (<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research.unsw.edu.au</a>). Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.<br /><br /><strong>Pathways</strong><br /><br />Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Climate Science receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.<br /><br />Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

Not only do personal computer systems, such as desktops and laptops fall into this category, but so do embedded systems for gaming, cars and PDAs, supercomputers used in climate modelling and gene analysis, and prosthetic systems such as ocular implants intended to improve quality of life. The challenge for the engineer is to design these systems with maximal impact, and to trade off competing factors using engineering, scientific and mathematical principles. This stream teaches the principles and techniques necessary to engineer high quality systems.</p>\n<p>Computer Engineering is studied as a major stream in the BE(Hons). Day to day administration of this stream is conducted through the Computer Science and Engineering Student Office.</p>\n<p>This page outlines the core rules for the Computer Engineering stream when taken as part of a single or dual award. The requirements total 168 units of credit, plus 60 days of industrial training. Refer to the program page for full details on the overall program requirements.</p>\n<p>Further details on the stream requirements, electives, and advice regarding the order and placement of courses in the stream can be found at the:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/studying-at-unsw/undergraduate/program-options/computer-engineering/single-award/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School website</a></p>",

        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), once simply a branch of computing research, has over the last decade moved into the mainstream of computational problem solving techniques. Many systems, from search engines to financial systems and health systems employ AI techniques such as machine learning. While true &#39;intelligence&#39; via computers is still remote, AI techniques are increasingly being used to enhance the performance of a vast range of existing systems, and to enable new applications, especially those involving large amounts of data.<br />\n<br />\nIn many applications (e.g. driverless vehicles), AI allows existing systems to work with less and less manual intervention. As autonomous devices become more common, potential employers include companies that can make ready use of automation. This includes companies concerned with home and office automation, entertainment companies and autonomous systems research and development. Autonomous systems and the sophisticated sensors they employ are also adopted in many industries to enhance production and to improve safety (e.g. mining, manufacturing, transport).<br />\n<br />\nThis stream introduces students to the foundations of artificial intelligence and the core technologies (machine learning, knowledge representation) that are required to apply AI in the real world.",

This is a high demand area of employment and is forecast to have serious undersupply of graduates to at least 2025. The cyber security education design is based on the security approaches of Ross Anderson and Bruce Schneier and incorporates an explicit engineering focus to security, rather than the more usual ad hoc &#34;hacker&#34;?, or commercial &#34;responsive&#34;? approaches of cyber security education.<br />\n<br />\nThe core courses in the stream teach analysis and systematic professional approaches to engineering security and examine failures, bugs, and human / system interactions and issues. There is an ongoing focus on security by design and professional ethical security practice.<br />\n<br />\nSpecialist elective courses allow students to specialise in their areas of interest and skill. Graduates of the stream are equipped for careers in penetration testing, incident response, software assessment, malware analysis, forensics, military or law enforcement, security consulting, and security lead in dev teams. This stream relies on students being exposed to C and to secure coding and vulnerabilities in first year including: memory use (data representation, the heap, function calls and the stack), and some assembly.",

The interdisciplinary environment at UNSW will also help you forge links with other areas of creative production such as screen writing, media and performing arts.</p>\n<p>Through workshop-based core courses at each level of the major, you will learn how to generate, draft, revise and edit your own writing, and to locate that writing in the context of both literary history and current literary trends. You will be exposed to new experimental techniques of writing and given the opportunity to reflect on how you want to contribute to literary culture. At the same time you will hone your critical and analytical skills to enable you to appraise and assess both your own work and the work of other writers.</p>\n<p>Prescribed electives at each level are offered to complement your writing with a more formal knowledge of literary genres and movements. The major challenges you to integrate a rigorous critical competency in areas such as poetics and narrative theory into the aesthetic choices you make as a writer. It also challenges you to consider the broader cultural and political implications of those choices and to imagine how you can engage with critical ideas and social debate through and in your own writing. Electives in other disciplines offer the opportunity to extend your writing skills in other media forms and establish formal connections with majors in film studies, media studies, and theatre and performance studies.</p>",

Honours in Ecology introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the biological, ecological and environmental sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project under the close supervision of academic(s) within the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Ecology must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Ecology (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours Program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Ecology stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline: <strong>Please note</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Biologyreceive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

Flexibility and choice are maintained throughout the entire structure by providing many elective courses.<br />\n<br />\nEnvironmental engineers are concerned with the environmental impact of engineering activities. They apply their broad knowledge of engineering and environmental processes in identifying environmental problems and in developing effective solutions to them. They also coordinate the activities of specialist groups such as biologists, ecologists and geologists within major projects. The discipline of environmental engineering embraces parts of civil engineering, with emphasis on management, systems design, water, geotechnical and transport engineering, together with aspects of chemical engineering, applied and biological sciences and environmental studies.<br />\n<br />\nThis stream can be taken on a four-year full-time basis or on a part-time basis subject to the approval of the Head of School. Intending part-time students are advised that all courses are offered only in the daytime.<br />\n<br />\nA detailed stream structure can be found on the School website, which includes suggested scheduling of courses by semester. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.",

Honours in Environmental Management introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the biological, ecological and environmental sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project\u00a0 under the close supervision of academics in the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>\n",

Entry is also possible for students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Environmental Management must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Environmental Management (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weighted average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Environmental Management stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the BEES Honours Program webpage (<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours</a>). It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via UNSW Research (<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research.unsw.edu.au</a>). Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Environmental Management receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Financial Technology (FinTech) is a rapidly growing field in finance where technology is used to enhance and reimagine financial services and sometimes results in disruptive changes. The most well-known examples are payment systems (PayPal, WeChat, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency), portfolio management and Robo-advice (US, Europe, Australia), peer-to-peer lending (US, China, India and elsewhere), high-frequency trading (global), and decentralized finance (of which Bitcoin and cryptocurrency form the foundation). Established financial services firms (BigTech) and entrepreneurs (FinTech) both demand talent in this space as FinTech products are by nature scalable and have potential for huge impact in a financial services business.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Co-developed with financial services industry experts, this major introduces students to finance theory, financial products, markets, and institutions, then explores how big data and other technologies allow FinTech start-ups to cause consumers to shift away from traditional finance - fundamentally changing the way money is raised, transferred, stored, loaned, and invested around the world. In addition to a conceptual understanding of finance theory, financial markets, and financial services firms, students will experience FinTech courses via the Integrated Learning Laboratory (iLab). They will be able to gain personal access to financial market data platforms, handle financial market and unstructured data, learn how financial products work via the Python programming language, trade using the leading stock trading platform used by brokerage firms, and interact with practitioners.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Bachelor of Commerce (Financial Technology) major can be taken standalone or be taken to complement other streams of studies such as finance, information system, computer science, engineering, law, and more. It is also available as a minor for students with a constrained degree program.</p>\n",

Your knowledge of chemical engineering, chemical product engineering or manufacturing engineering brings valuable skills to transform the food industry, allowing you to effectively scale food production while ensuring that our food supports and improves both individual and planetary health. You will work with food scientists, food technologists, nutrition professionals, product developers and marketers to innovate and develop new food products and processes. Food processing at scale requires the understanding of the core subjects from your engineering Honours stream, while also understanding the biological complexities of foods. Foods are perishable having a certain shelf life, they are ingested with the purpose of nourishment and enjoyment \u2013 so processing must retain, or enhance, their nutritional characteristics. As a graduate from this stream, you will be a sought-after professional who can excel in food manufacturing, with unique skills, able to lead multidisciplinary teams that work towards nourishing the world\u2019s growing population.</p>",

The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process.

Workshops are held in the first week of Honours. Please note, the workshops&#39; exact topics and schedules may vary subject to staff availability.</p>\n\n<p>Students are required to submit exercises for feedback but does not contribute to final honours grade.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Literature review</strong></p>\n\n<p>A major written assignment of ca. 3,000 words on the topic of each student&#39;s project and selected in consultation with the project supervisor will be written. The aim is to familiarize students with library and resource usage and to develop a critical approach in assessing published literature in the area relevant to the research project.</p>\n\n<p>Detailed feedback by primary supervisor. This is assessment of written skills that will scaffold the student learning and provides formative assessment leading to the final summative assessment in the introduction of the final thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Present research plan to lab groups; 15 minutes with 5 minutes for questions</p>\n\n<p>Feedback by primary supervisor.

The text of the report should be 2000 words or less. You must stay under the word limit. Three or four figures and/or tables must be included. The text should include a brief Introduction. The focus should be on the presentation and discussion of your data. Assessors will expect figures, tables and text to be presented professionally and at the standard of an acceptable scientific journal. The grade of satisfactory or unsatisfactory is not used to predict the final outcome of the thesis, simply to indicate the committees view on the thesis as presented.</p>\n\n<p>Internally examined by at least 2 reviewers and critical feedback given to student. This task scaffolds the student learning and provides formative assessment leading to the final summative assessment in the final thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice thesis interview</strong></p>\n\n<p>To facilitate feedback the Assessment Committee will interview the student to discuss the practice thesis. Students will be interviewed by their Assessment Committee to evaluate the extent of the student&#39;s knowledge and to confirm that the student is fully in possession of the contents of their thesis.</p>\n\n<p>This task serves as a major component of the student&#39;s training for writing the final thesis and as practice for the final interview. Detailed feedback concerning the expectations for preparation of the final thesis will be provided at this time.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Present research findings; 15 minutes with 5 minutes for questions.</p>\n\n<p>Students are graded by the academics in the audience. Students are assessed based on delivery of content, background knowledge of their field, and understanding of the significance of their findings in the context of their field of study.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 10%</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thesis</strong></p>\n\n<p>A final research thesis is to be submitted at the end of the year that details the results and significance of findings of the project undertaken.</p>\n\n<p>The following is a breakdown of the weighting of the different thesis sections:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Introduction (20%) - The literature must be adequately described and understood by the student, and critical review of the literature is an indication of thorough understanding of the topic. <em>This component comprises essentially a major literature review undertaken by the students earlier in their year in which they are provided critical feedback on.</em></li><li>Methods (10%) - The Methods section should be described in sufficient detail to allow experiments to be reproduced. <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li><li>Results (30%) - Experiments should be presented in a logical sequence and there should be enough data presented in order for the committee to assess the level of commitment to the research project. <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li><li>Discussion (30%) - Students should critically assess their own work and the work done by others, discussing the significance of their results in context with published work in the field. <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li><li>General presentation (10%) - The thesis should be well written with a minimum of errors, with accurate, complete, and error free references (both in the text and in the reference list). <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li></ul>\n\n<p>Internally examined by at least 2 independent reviewers. Internally examined by at least two independent reviewers. Each member of the thesis committee will independently read and assess the final thesis without consultation with each other. After meeting with the student in the final thesis interview, the student will be excused and the committee will come to an agreement on the final mark for thesis. If there is a discrepancy and the committee cannot come to an agreement on the final mark, then a fourth examiner can be called for to provide another independent assessment of the thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 80%</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final thesis interview</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students will be interviewed by their Assessment Committee to evaluate the extent of the student&#39;s knowledge and to confirm that the student is fully in possession of the contents of their thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Students are graded by their committee based on their interview. Students are assessed based on their ability to articulate verbally the significance of their findings, an understanding of the methods they employed, an ability to answer questions, and a background understanding of the field of study.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 10%</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Honours Grade Calculation</strong><br />\n<br />\nHons.

A panel will then determine the allocation of final honours grade.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Requirements and Process</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Requirements</em></p>\n\n<p>Admission to Honours is competitive, and depends on academic merit as well as the availability of an approved supervisor. Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors.

Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Genetics may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Genetics have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",

These changes, among many others, at their most fundamental are about social and environmental dynamics and their relationship across space and time. The field of geography is strongly situated to analyse these dynamics, drawing insights from social and physical sciences. Given this set of disciplinary skills, geographers are employed in a range of different professions, including urban management, regional planning, environmental assessment, advocacy and international development, and education.</p>\n<p>Courses in the minor will provide you with a critical understanding of the human and physical basis of geography. Its offerings will provide also you with diverse opportunities for field trips, conducting data analysis, engaging with policy debates and interrogating key sub-fields within the broader geographical discipline. The wide range of\u00a0courses on offer also means that you will be able to tailor your degree around broader themes such as \u2018development geographies\u2019, \u2018international geographies\u2019 \u2018geohumanities\u2019 the \u2018physical environment\u2019 and \u2018environmental geography\u2019.\u00a0</p>",

Honours in Geography introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical and social environmental sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which includes a literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial an independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics within the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Geography stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a>\u00a0webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via\u00a0<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note:</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Geography receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

Honours in Geology introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the earth sciences and geosciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and an independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics in the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Geology must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Geology (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Geology stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a>\u00a0webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via\u00a0<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline:\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Geology receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

However, anatomy today is much more than the descriptive study of the dissected body, although dissected specimens, along with immersive technologies such as virtual reality, are used for research and instruction. The study of anatomy now embraces separate but strongly related disciplines: gross anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply; histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells; embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations; neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord; biological anthropology involves applying biological principles and approaches to the study of humans &amp; non-human primates.</p>\n<p>We are ranked 41 (2020) in the world for anatomy and physiology. At UNSW, all anatomy courses have a strong emphasis on living anatomy with functional and clinical significance of the structures in health and in disease. Anatomy is also applied to related disciplines of biomedical engineering, medical imaging and diagnostic technology, and the virtual and augmented reality.</p>\n<p>Careers in anatomy include medicine, medical research, neuroscience, reproductive technologies (IVF) and allied health disciplines such as Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology. You could pursue a career as a radiographer forensic anthropologist, immersive (VR, AR) developer, and a data specialist. Studying anatomy also prepares students well for careers in medicine and is especially relevant clinical skills, surgery and radiological imaging.</p>\n<p>Anatomy may be combined with elective courses in Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, Pathology or Psychology.</p>",

When the abilities and limitations of humans are not identified and designed for within a work environment, significant failures can occur. Such failures can affect the health and safety of both individuals and the organisation, and can have significant economic and reputational implications.</p>\n<p>In the aviation industry, human error has been observed to have a highly detrimental effect in areas such as flight operations, maintenance practices and air traffic management. In fact, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) states human error as the single most serious threat to aviation safety with human error being cited as the main cause of up to 80 percent of incidents and accidents in the aviation industry and more than 70 percent of commercial aeroplane hull-loss accidents.</p>\n<p>Understanding human factors and safety holistically is key for designing well-considered work systems that can mitigate the risk of human failures by taking the abilities and limitations of humans into account. In a time where the aviation industry is undergoing a &#34;technological renaissance&#34; with the introduction of emerging technologies and initiatives, there is an ever-increasing need for aviation managers with a deep and current understanding of safety management systems to ensure safe handling and operations of aircraft, airspace and people working within these systems.</p>\n<p>In this Human Factors and Aviation Safety 24 UOC minor, students will be provided with an opportunity to undertake current, relevant and thought-provoking learning with key human factors experts in academia and the aviation industry, leading to the acquisition of a specialised set of skills highly desired in industry for\u00a0effectively managing human factors and safety systems in an aviation context.</p>",

Pathology provides an understanding of the causes of disease, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the symptoms, and potential complications of disease. An understanding of pathological process is also essential to guide the development of new diagnostic tests and novel treatments for a range of diseases including Cancer and Covid-19.</p>\n<p>Undergraduate Pathology involves the study of various disease processes including inflammation, wound healing, vascular diseases, immunological responses, musculoskeletal diseases and cancers. Students become familiar with examining macroscopic specimens of diseased tissue, microscopic differences between normal and abnormal cells, tissues and organs as well as interpretation of basic diagnostic laboratory investigations and imaging. Much of the study of microscopic abnormalities is undertaken using computer-based &#39;virtual&#39; microscopy. Students also become familiar with the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of disease. Courses offered in Pathology allow in-depth study of many fascinating and important disorders such as meningitis, tuberculosis, autoimmune diseases, genetic diseases, a variety of cancers, HIV/AIDS, heart disease, asthma, musculoskeletal diseases and even COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Some examples of careers that students studying Pathology may pursue include:</p>\n<ul><li>Medical researcher (including in government, industry or university laboratories);</li><li>Laboratory technician;</li><li>Pharmaceutical sales representative;</li><li>Medical-scientific liaison;</li><li>Regulatory affairs officer.</li></ul>\n<p>Note that graduates with a Major in Pathology are not \u201cPathologists\u201d.

This introductory approach is critical to developing your interest while preparing you for the inevitable contests in a complex field of study. The grounds of deeper contests arising from colonial ruptures are not engaged until levels two &amp; three. Here you will engage with content in more depth, and at the level of theory. The structure of the Indigenous Studies Minor provides you with an opportunity to further study level two and three courses within the suite of Indigenous studies course offerings. The Indigenous Studies Minor is available as a complementary to another area of specialisation.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in developing depth knowledge across a range of issues in Indigenous studies, then you should consider studying the Indigenous Studies Major.</p>",

As a student studying the Indigenous Studies Major, you will be led in a sequential way to understand that solutions in practice requires deep, ongoing, critical reflection at the level of theory and practice.</p>\n<p>The learning experience across the levels has been configured to allow for transferability of skills and knowledge into other contexts.</p>\n<p>You will begin by focusing on the continuities of Indigenous ways of understanding the world. In this way you will be drawn into an awareness of Indigenous knowledge and tradition as an organiser of Indigenous worlds and continuing Indigenous practices. This alerts you to your prior assumptions, positions the contests that occur within Indigenous Studies, and prepares you for deeper intellectual inquiry at levels two and three.</p>\n<p>The Indigenous Studies Major culminates in a capstone course, where you will practice navigating a range of issues potentially encountered in the workplace. Understanding Indigenous knowledge and practice, and the historical relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia are required for comprehension of the complex mix of continuities, ruptures and convergences that condition the contemporary Indigenous position and how it can be understood.</p>\n<p>The Indigenous Studies Major is designed for those of you seeking to specialise in Indigenous Studies as the central focus of your degree program.

This region, with Southeast Asia and Oceania at its centre, is of great strategic importance to Australia. Taking Indo-Pacific studies will allow you to deepen your understanding of the regional landscape and gain insights into the histories, culture, and geo-political outlook of other countries in the region. Solving the pressing regional challenges of our age \u2013 including development and inequality, climate change and human security, and great power competition \u2013 requires greater cooperation among Indo-Pacific countries. Achieving such cooperation requires not only technical understanding of regional processes and institutions, but also the perspective regional partners bring to the table. Pursuing a minor in Indo-Pacific Studies will allow you to develop a more informed perspective on the region and equip you as part of a generation of future leaders to pursue both collaboration with regional partners and stability and peace in the Indo-Pacific.</p>",

This region, with Southeast Asia and Oceania at its centre, is of great strategic importance to Australia. Taking Indo-Pacific studies will allow you to deepen your understanding of the regional landscape and gain insights into the histories, culture, and geo-political outlook of other countries in the region. Solving the pressing regional challenges of our age \u2013 including development and inequality, climate change and human security, and great power competition \u2013 requires greater cooperation among Indo-Pacific countries. Achieving such cooperation requires not only technical understanding of regional processes and institutions, but also the perspective regional partners bring to the table. Pursuing a major in Indo-Pacific Studies will allow you to develop a more informed perspective on the region, and equip you as part of a generation of future leaders to pursue both collaboration with regional partners and stability and peace in the Indo-Pacific.</p>",

Studying International Political Economy (IPE) enables you to come to grips with some of the most pressing questions in and of global politics today. You will enquire into the nature of both global and local relations of economic power, including how they are sustained by shifting patterns of knowledge and authority. You will examine the features and dynamics of forces such as capitalism, globalisation, neo- and postcolonialism, and will investigate the histories, knowledges and roles of particular actors, ideas, agendas and experiences. You will explore the fault lines created by global integration, economic crisis and deepening social, political and economic inequality. As you develop your ideas and build a personal, and always political, sense of how politics shapes economics, and vice versa, you will participate directly in the evolving relationship between theory, practice and policymaking.</p>",

What is the biological basis for language? Is language unique to the human species? How and why do languages change? How do children learn language? What is the meaning of &#39;meaning&#39;? Can machines talk? How does language relate to other modes of communication? Linguistics also provides the basis for a variety of practical applications including, at UNSW, the teaching and learning of foreign languages, translating and interpreting, facilitating cross-cultural communication, developing language curricula in schools, and improving literacy skills.</p>",

Honours in Marine Science introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical, environmental and ecological sciences with an emphasis on marine, aquatic and coastal environments. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three terms, includes a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and partly independent Research Project. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines or programs at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Admission Process</strong></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Marine Science stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline. <strong>Please note:</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program receive some Advanced Standing in <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">8623 Masters of Environmental Management</a> and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

Students are expected to formulate their project rationale, objectives, literature survey, and project management plan, done formally in <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/MATS4504.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MATS4504 Research Training</a> (6UOC), then undertake and complete the work in a timely manner over one term. In most cases the project will involve substantial experimental work and this is usually done within established research groups in the School as well as in collaboration with other groups in the University and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The principal form of teaching is based on research supervision and direction by specialist researchers within the School of Materials Science and Engineering. Complementing this, students must complete <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/MATS4503.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MATS4503 Professional Skills</a> (6UOC) which includes formal training in professional communication, writing skills, project planning, data analysis, intellectual property, and risk management and workplace safety.</p>\n\n<p>Learning outcomes from this Honours stream will form the basis for future pursuits in materials science research but are also highly relevant for many other professions - both within the materials industry, but also in many other related yet diverse fields.</p>\n\n<p>The School offers a wide variety of student research projects in the Materials Science discipline including topics on synthesis and production of advanced materials, materials recycling, functional materials, sustainable materials, advanced surface coatings, electrical materials, biomedical materials, physical metallurgy, process metallurgy, etc. Most students would complete Honours as full-time students, where the program is completed over three consecutive terms. Part-time study is also possible depending on availability of supervision and suitable projects. Most students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (February) but Term 3 (September) entry\u00a0is available.

They are found in all classes of materials: metals, ceramics, polymers, and organic molecules. Functional materials show great promise for many strategic technological advances that will change the way in which materials are used. Typical applications include devices for electromagnetic applications, energy generation, electro- and magneto- caloric materials for energy storage, solar harvesting functions, and semiconductor logic and memory technology.<br /><br />Functional Materials are introduced comprehensively in Stages 3 and 4 by a number of professional electives. Students also undertake a materials design project and a substantial thesis project. Students may complete the first one or two years of their degree at their local university engineering school and then transfer with advanced standing to UNSW.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The discipline of mathematics at UNSW is divided into several areas of study: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pure Mathematics</em> is the study of the essential structures of mathematics. Work by pure mathematicians underpins most of the technological advances of this century. Pure Mathematics is concerned with problems and techniques which transcend specific applications. Research, focusing on the development of existing theories or the creation of new ones, may be driven by applications or by the internal demands of the discipline. Pure Mathematics courses provide the insights and understanding required by those using mathematics, leading to mastery of the fundamental processes of mathematical science and the capacity for innovative applications in any area.</p>\n\n<p><em>Applied Mathematics</em> concerns the development of mathematics and models for understanding scientific phenomena, for the solution of technical and industrial problems, and for use in the social, economic and management sciences. Courses are designed to provide basic mathematical and computational skills needed for a wide range of applications, to develop the capability to construct, analyse and interpret mathematical models, and to encourage enthusiasm for the role of the mathematician in a variety of contexts.</p>\n\n<p><em>Statistics</em> is the science and art of using factual material for modelling and inference. Its mathematical foundations are in the theory of probability and it deals with how to estimate and make decisions using knowledge which is uncertain or observational material which is subject to error. There is a rich interplay of ideas between the theory of statistics and fields such as engineering, medicine and biological and behavioural sciences where statistical problems constantly arise.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for a major in Mathematics for Education as part of a concurrent Bachelor of Science / Bachelor of Education program (4076). Only students enrolled concurrently in both a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Education program may take this major. The major ensures that students meet all accreditation requirements with the NSW Institute of Teachers.</p>\n",

        "description": "The Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream is designed for students with a mechanical engineering major whose interests also lie in realising, commercialising and implementing mechanical and mechatronic systems and designs. The five core courses included as part of this stream have been designed on the basis of world best practice in manufacturing and industrial engineering and reflect a top-down - bottom-up approach, spanning the disciplines of Strategy and Management, Operations and Supply Chains, Analysis and Decision-making, Design of Product-Process Systems and Technology &amp; Automation.<br />\n<br />\nWithin each discipline area this new stream will cover many conceptual and analytical techniques, all supporting fact- and data-based analysis and decision making with the aim of improved product and process performance, economy and sustainability. This stream is designed to help you to learn how to transform a design from a conceptual stage into a prototype and ultimately into a commercially realisable and viable product. This stream focuses on technical as well as commercial aspects and particularly in developing the ability to build a business or commercial case for making engineering related decisions, such as investment in plant, equipment and processes. Although the main emphasis will be on product and process, consideration will also be given to designing compatible and appropriate engineering support services. The stream also emphasises the strategic impact of operations decisions and the interfaces between operations and the other functional areas of organisations, including of course, finance. This stream encompasses the key elements of operations management and investment analysis and pulls them together in a coherent format that allows you to understand the &#39;big picture&#39; as well as &#39;the specific details&#39;. It is aimed at integrating the knowledge gained from the mechanical engineering courses you have studied into a framework and process that allows you to implement your designs, solutions and ideas in a commercial environment.<br />\n<br />\nMechanical engineers have traditionally played the major role in the analysis and design of complex machinery, devices such as actuators and sensors, as well as energy transformation, heat transfer and electro-mechanical processes. In an environment of global competition, sustainability (energy, environment as well as cost and capital), increasingly complex customer requirements and statutory regulations as well as the increasing pace of technological change and new product innovation, it is vital for modern engineers to possess the skills to not only design but equally importantly, implement and realize their designs in the most appropriate way. In this increasingly complex environment, successful organizations - public, private or governmental - need engineers with analytical and diverse skills, especially in integrating technical with commercial and organisational issues, analyses and ultimately solutions. It is the purpose and aim of the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream to equip you with this knowledge and understanding to become a global engineer, indeed a leader, with the ability to apply analytical methods and quality processes to create short and long term value for your organization, your customers, and the community. It encapsulates the key elements of mechanical engineering and combines them with the five core disciplines of manufacturing and industrial engineering.<br />\n<br />\nAn engineer trained in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering may be employed in a very flexible and diverse range of disciplines and areas of industrial activity, including; product design, process design, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, quality improvement, technical and commercial analysis and decision making, strategic decision making, consulting, sales support, technical and organisational maintenance, and supply chain management.",

After building a firm foundation in media studies debates, methods, and history, you\u2019ll choose from a suite of electives that allow you to sharpen your focus on questions of justice, race, ethics, or emerging technologies.</p>\n<p>You will develop critical thinking and writing skills that allow you to make persuasive arguments, engage with challenging issues, and solve new problems. With an array of research methods and analytical techniques in your toolkit, you\u2019ll be able to bring to bear a combination of critical and creative skills and knowledges.</p>\n<p>When you graduate, you\u2019ll be ready to work across the media industries of today \u2013 and with the critical knowledge and skills you need to adapt to whatever the future brings.</p>",

However, microorganisms are also of great benefit. Indeed, microorganisms are the key participants for the turnover of nutrients and elements and they are the main producers of organic carbon and biomass. They turn the biological wheels on this globe and are responsible for sustainability of life. They also contribute to a better environment via recycling of organic wastes, maintenance of soil fertility and biodegradation of pollutants. Many foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals and other products of biotechnology are products of microbial action.

Students are assessed based on their ability to articulate verbally the significance of their findings, an understanding of the methods they employed, an ability to answer questions, and a background understanding of the field of study.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 10%</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Honours Grade Calculation</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>Hons. Class I (\u2265 85%)</em><br />\nWork of excellent critical evaluation through substantial independence and self-direction, reflecting superior quality in all aspects of research, writing and presentation. The work has no significant errors or/and deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><em>Hons. Class II, Division I (75% to 84%)</em><br />\nWork of very good critical evaluation through substantial independence and self-direction, reflecting very good quality in all aspects of research, writing and presentation.</p>\n\n<p><em>Hons. Class II, Division 2 (65% to 74%)</em><br />\nWork of good quality in research, writing and presentation but with some significant errors or/and deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><em>Hons. Class III (50% to 64%)</em><br />\nWork is in acceptable form and demonstrates basic research, writing and presentation skills. The work has several significant deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><em>Fail (&lt;50%)</em><br />\nWork has a number of major flaws and there is evidence of lack of basic knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be reviewed by at least two internal reviewers other than the supervisor(s). A panel will then determine the allocation of final honours grade.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>Admission to Honours is competitive, and depends on academic merit as well as the availability of an approved supervisor. Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Process</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about staff research interests and the process of applying for Honours can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours-mphil-babs</a>, and appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS website</a>. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">the School of BABS website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Microbiology may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Microbiology have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>The Honours program in Molecular and Cell Biology aims to help students achieve, through research, a deeper and skilled understanding of a specific aspects of molecular and cell biology while developing their critical thinking, writing and presentation skills.</p>\n\n<p>Students undertake a supervised research project in an area of research significance as approved by the Head of School. The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Molecular and Cell Biology can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Molecular and Cell Biology is to be completed full-time. Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with the undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516 BABS Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM lower than 65 and/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about the process of applying for Honours can be found here <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours</a>, and other appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date (typically February for S1 and June for S2).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Molecular and Cell Biology may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Molecular and Cell Biology have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n",

A list of available supervisors, their research areas, and the research skills that you would learn, are available on the Neuroscience Honours Supervisors page. You should speak with one or more supervisors before submitting your application form.</p>\n\n<p>The Neuroscience Honours course is a research based full year research project with assessment by thesis (75%) and by a coursework component (25%). Students must enrol in two 6 UOC courses from NEUR441X and NEUR442X (current courses are NEUR4411 Behavioural Perspectives in Neuroscience and [[NEUR4421 Biomedical Perspectives in Neuroscience). The research project occupies the other 36 UOC, which students take by enrolling in a combination of NEUR444X Neuroscience Research courses that add up to 36 UOC.</p>\n",

Furthermore, understanding of this amazing and complex organ can shed light not only on understanding our how our body organs are controlled, and how our responses to different external stimuli, but can also shed light on how prior experiences impact on these organ and body responses. Indeed, the complex processes that the brain uses to integrate different stimuli with prior experiences can also lead to new technologies and approaches to benefit society.\u00a0\u00a0 Neuroscience is a cross-disciplinary topic and the program introduces you to this study of the biology of the brain and how neural activity results in specific behaviours through different disciplines of Physiology, Psychology, Anatomy and Pharmacology. The flexibility of different subject options within the Program reflects this cross-disciplinary input into studying Brain and behaviour.\n\n\n",

In parallel, growth will also be required in the non-defence nuclear supply chain, including but not limited to safeguards regulators, safety regulators, manufacturing and engineering consulting. Engineering graduates with some exposure to nuclear knowledge, as provided by a Minor program, are already in high demand, in this growing sector.</p>\n<p>The Nuclear Engineering Minor aims to provide undergraduate students with a foundation in nuclear engineering, in preparation for entering the nuclear workforce. The Minor encourages you to combine skills learnt from traditional engineering disciplines with specialist knowledge to solve the challenges facing nuclear technology. You will become nuclear-conversant, learn the underlying theory behind nuclear engineering techniques, explore the role of nuclear energy in a low-carbon future and gain an appreciation for the investigation and enforcement of regulations.</p>\n<p>The 24 UOC of courses required for the Minor can be course shared with courses taken for other program requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Completion of the minor will require the choice of ENGG3741 as a discipline elective (or breadth elective for ELECAH3707 and CEICAH3707) within their major stream.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Students completing the following majors can complete the minor within their program requirements:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Aerospace\u200b Engineering \u00a0</li><li>Chemical\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Chemical Product\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Civil\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Environmental\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Electrical Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Mechanical\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Mechatronic Engineering\u00a0\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Students completing the following majors cannot complete the minor within their program requirements:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Bioinformatics\u00a0</li><li>Computer Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Mining Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Petroleum Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Photovoltaics and Solar Energy\u00a0</li><li>Quantum Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Renewable Energy Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Software Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Surveying\u00a0</li><li>Telecommunications\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Students in dual degrees are not likely to have space within their program requirements to complete the minor.</p>",

Honours in Palaeoscience introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical environmental sciences including archaeology, evolutionary anthropology, palaeoclimate, palaeoecology, palaeontology and past human environmental interactions and hazards. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics within the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours Program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Palaeoscience stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline. <strong>Please note:</strong> this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program in Geography are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program receive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

Pathology provides an understanding of the causes of disease, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the symptoms, and potential complications of disease. An understanding of pathological process is also essential to guide the development of new diagnostic tests and novel treatments for a range of diseases including Cancer and Covid-19.</p>\n<p>Undergraduate Pathology involves the study of various disease processes including inflammation, wound healing, vascular diseases, immunological responses, musculoskeletal diseases and cancers. Students become familiar with examining macroscopic specimens of diseased tissue, microscopic differences between normal and abnormal cells, tissues and organs as well as interpretation of basic diagnostic laboratory investigations and imaging. Much of the study of microscopic abnormalities is undertaken using computer-based &#39;virtual&#39; microscopy. Students also become familiar with the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of disease. Courses offered in Pathology allow in-depth study of many fascinating and important disorders such as meningitis, tuberculosis, autoimmune diseases, genetic diseases, a variety of cancers, HIV/AIDS, heart disease, asthma, musculoskeletal diseases and even COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Some examples of careers that students studying Pathology may pursue include:</p>\n<ul><li>Medical researcher (including in government, industry or university laboratories);</li><li>Laboratory technician;</li><li>Pharmaceutical sales representative;</li><li>Medical-scientific liaison;</li><li>Regulatory affairs officer.</li></ul>\n<p>Note that graduates with a Major in Pathology are not \u201cPathologists\u201d. A Pathologist is a medical doctor with specialist training in Pathology. However, a major in Pathology will provide a strong foundation for students interested in applying for postgraduate medicine programs.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.<br /><br /></strong>Philosophy enables students to reflect critically on the commitments and values that shape human life. In ordinary life, we make assessments of character and action, of laws and institutions, of media and art, of the soundness of one another\u2019s beliefs. What values are implicit in these assessments? And what justifies these commitments to value? Answers to these questions often draw on even more fundamental commitments about existence and knowledge. What is a person? Do we have freedom of will? What is a mind, and how does it relate to the brain? Could computers one day have minds? What is sensible experience, and how can it justify claims about an independent world? Are there limits to human knowledge \u2014 and how could we know what these limits are?</p>\n<p>The philosophy curriculum at UNSW explores such questions. You will gain an expanded understanding of the human, social, and natural world, and appreciate complex relationships and interactions across these domains. You will discover how ethical norms, political institutions, and social practices can both foster and constrain creativity and innovation. You will appreciate how fundamental concepts that underpin scientific and humanistic inquiry \u2013 concepts as fundamental as \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cmind\u201d \u2013 have been contested, and their meanings debated, over time. And since philosophical inquiry is highly driven by understanding and assessing arguments, you will develop valuable skills of critical thinking, sound reasoning, and clear interpretive and analytical writing.</p>\n<p>The curriculum covers the key areas of the discipline with attention to how its fundamental concepts have developed both in Western and Chinese traditions. Students completing the minor will gain competency across the key areas of the discipline: logic and reasoning; metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of mind; moral, social and political philosophy; and the history of philosophy.</p>",

Could computers one day have minds?\u00a0 What is sensible experience, and how can it justify claims about an independent world?\u00a0 Are there limits to human knowledge \u2014 and how could we know what these limits are?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The philosophy curriculum at UNSW explores such questions. You will gain an expanded understanding of the human, social, and natural world, and appreciate complex relationships and interactions across these domains. You will discover how ethical norms, political institutions, and social practices can both foster and constrain creativity and innovation.\u00a0 You will appreciate how fundamental concepts that underpin scientific and humanistic inquiry \u2013 concepts as fundamental as \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cmind\u201d \u2013 have been contested, and their meanings debated, over time. And since philosophical inquiry is highly driven by understanding and assessing arguments, you will develop valuable skills of critical thinking, sound reasoning, and clear interpretive and analytical writing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The curriculum covers the key areas of the discipline with attention to how its fundamental concepts have developed both in Western and Chinese traditions.\u00a0 Students completing the Philosophy major specialisation at UNSW will gain competency across the key areas of the discipline: logic and reasoning; metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of mind; moral, social and political philosophy; and the history of philosophy.\u00a0</p>",

Emphasis is placed on gaining hands-on experience of working with solar energy devices, modules and systems.<br /><br />Innovative teaching techniques have been developed to enhance the learning environment including the &#39;Virtual Production Line&#39; and &#39;Virtual World Solar Car Challenge&#39;. UNSW academics in the photovoltaic field have been consistently ranked amongst the leaders worldwide through international peer review. This team has held the world record for silicon solar cell efficiencies for decades and were responsible for developing the most successfully commercialized new photovoltaic technology internationally throughout the same period. From 2006 onwards we have seen an explosion of interest in the School&#39;s technologies from major industry players all around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Area of Specialisation</strong></p>\n<p>The cross-disciplinary nature of photovoltaics and renewable energy applications necessitates many PV engineers possessing broad engineering backgrounds or else working in teams with other engineers. A good example is the UNSW Solar Car Project involving PV engineers, electronics engineers, control engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, power engineers, biomedical engineers, computer engineers, and communication engineers. Therefore it is important for photovoltaic engineers to have a broader understanding of other engineering disciplines.</p>\n<p>A unique feature of this specialisation is that in Year 2, students have the opportunity to select a strand to complement their education in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy. Each strand comprises 18 units of credit with the opportunity to subsequently select additional electives in the corresponding area in the final two years, subject to the approval of the Undergraduate Coordinator. The strands available are listed below and cover areas such as computing, electronics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, physics, chemical engineering, and architecture. Students may also formulate their own strands subject to the approval of the Undergraduate Coordinator.</p>\n<p>Selection of a second area of specialisation is subject to the specialisation rule that states that no more than 60 UOC of first-year level courses may be counted toward the BE (Hons) in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy.</p>\n<p>Photovoltaics and Solar Energy is also available as a component of the double degree programs.</p>",

Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entry Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>So that students have sufficient background to attempt the courses in the honours year, students must discuss their selection of Level III courses with the Applied Mathematics Honours Coordinator or another academic adviser.</p>\n\n<p>To enter honours in applied mathematics, students must have</p>\n\n<ul><li>Completed a mathematics major in the Science or Advanced Science program or a physical oceanography major in the Science program, including at least 30 units of credit in Level III mathematics or which at least 18uoc must in in level III applied mathematics, <strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of the applied mathematics plan in the Advanced Mathematics degree <strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of the advanced physical oceanography major in Advanced Science or</li><li>Completed a suitable mathematics or statistics degree at another university.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>In addition</em>, students will normally be required to have:</p>\n\n<ul><li>An average above 70 in their level III mathematics courses <strong>and</strong></li><li>An average above 70 in level III applied mathematics courses.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The level III applied mathematics courses at UNSW are those courses numbered from MATH3010 to MATH3399 inclusive.<br />\nWith the permission of the Head of School (or nominee), a student may be allowed into Physical Oceanography\u00a0Honours without having satisfied the specific departmental requirements, and instead have shown some evidence of the ability to undertake independent study.</p>\n",

These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time)\u00a0can complete the honours thesis\u00a0 in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also be required to participate in the weekly honours seminar, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. This seminar is intended to allow students to\u00a0practise their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities.\u00a0Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff. The supervisor or supervisors of the thesis is expected to submit a report, but will not be a marker for the thesis. Students are required to give a short seminar on their thesis and this will account for 10% of the final mark for the thesis, the remaining 90% coming from the written thesis report.</p>\n\n<p>The 30uoc coursework component of Physical Oceanography\u00a0honours will consist of five 6uoc lecture courses at honours/postgraduate level (typically MATH5xxx courses).\u00a0 The suite of courses must be approved by the Head of School or nominee and taken with the advice of the honours thesis supervisor. A student may be permitted to take one or, exceptionally, at most two, courses from outside the School of MathsStats, for example at the AMSI summer school, at another institution or at another UNSW academic unit.</p>\n\n<p>The marks for the thesis and other honours courses will be combined to give a weighted average mark forming a final honours mark which will be rounded up and used to decide the grade of honours the student will be awarded as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Honours class 1 -- final mark of 85 or over</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 1 -- final mark from 75 to 84</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 2 -- final mark from 65 to 74</li><li>Honours class 3 -- final mark from 50 to 64</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who successfully complete Mathematics or Statistics Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by applying to undertake postgraduate studies by PhD or Masters. Students with successful honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW. Students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.

Projects are offered in all areas of research in the School: Astrophysics; Biophysics; Condensed Matter Physics; Music Acoustics and Theoretical Physics. Projects are also offered by academics in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology. A list of projects and supervisors will be available in the term before students begin honours.\u00a0Students are assessed by submission of a research proposal, literature review, and final thesis. The research proposal is worth 10%, the literature review contributes 20% and the thesis contributes 70% to the final research mark. These will be marked by two assessors within the School, one of whom will be the student&#39;s supervisor.

The policy process is multifaceted and complex with different actors and interests that seek to influence outcomes at global, national, and local levels. In this minor, you will discover how policy is made and how policy problems are defined. You will explore the politics, values and ideology behind the decisions. You will develop skills to analyse policy, use evidence to develop policy advice, work with stakeholders to shape policy, and evaluate policy outcomes. You will reflect critically on the impact of policy on specific sectors and communities. You will explore the different ways that citizens, businesses, communities and advocacy organisations can participate in policy making that affects them, and work with government in formulating policy and delivering services.</p>\n<p>This minor is designed to complement your disciplinary major and develop policy-relevant skills to help you to make an impact in your chosen field of practice. It will prepare you for careers in government, politics, media, think tanks, international and local non-government organisations and businesses with an interest in solving problems and influencing social change.</p>",

Atomic-size systems behave according to quantum mechanics, which allows them to exhibit rather spectacular properties and dynamics. This stream trains students to design and operate devices that behave according to quantum mechanics, opening the possibility to exploit the peculiar laws of quantum physics to perform otherwise cumbersome or impossible tasks, such as the efficient solution of computationally hard problems, or the secure teleportation of information. Graduates from this stream will have valuable skills that position them ideally for the burgeoning quantum engineering industry, as well as broad skills across most key electrical engineering disciplines.</p>",

For over 100 years, it has been known that the behaviour of physical systems at the atomic scale does not obey the familiar laws of classical physics. Atomic-size systems behave according to quantum mechanics, which allows them to exhibit rather spectacular properties and dynamics. This stream trains students to design and operate devices that behave according to quantum mechanics, opening the possibility to exploit the peculiar laws of quantum physics to perform otherwise cumbersome or impossible tasks, such as the efficient solution of computationally hard problems, or the secure teleportation of information. Graduates from this stream will have valuable skills that position them ideally for the burgeoning quantum engineering industry, as well as broad skills across most key electrical engineering disciplines.</p>",

A\u00a0major in Sociology will equip you with the intellectual and practical tools to tackle contemporary social problems and inequalities such as those related to race, gender, sexuality, and class.\u00a0 It will also help you to analyse the complexities of rapid social change, technological disruption, and political polarisation to better understand how to make change in the world. Sociology graduates are therefore ideally positioned to make an impact in roles associated with policy making and government, social and community services, and research and academia. Most importantly, sociology will change the way you see the world and your place within it.\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>",

We offer expert supervision across a wide range of areas in modern mathematics and statistics. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians and statisticians.<br />\nStudents who enrol in the Statistics Honours Stream are expected to have completed a statistics or mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0statistics may also apply for entry to this stream.<br />\nHonours in Statistics\u00a0can be completed full-time or part-time.

Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entry Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>So that students have sufficient background to attempt the courses in the honours year, students must discuss their selection of Level III courses with the\u00a0Statistics Honours Coordinator or another academic adviser.</p>\n\n<p>To enter honours in Statistics, students must have</p>\n\n<ul><li>Completed a Statistics major in the Science or Advanced Science program <strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of the Advanced Statistics plans in the Advanced Mathematics degree <strong>or</strong>;</li><li>Completed a suitable mathematics or statistics degree at another university.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>In addition</em>, students will normally be required to have:</p>\n\n<ul><li>An average above 70 in their level III mathematics courses <strong>and</strong></li><li>An average above 70 in level III statistics courses.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The level III statistics courses at UNSW are those courses numbered from MATH3800 to MATH3999 inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>With the permission of the Head of School (or nominee), a student may be allowed into Statistics\u00a0Honours without having satisfied the specific departmental requirements, and instead have shown some evidence of the ability to undertake independent study.</p>\n",

This stream aims to prepare a graduate for a broad range of career opportunities in the various branches of Surveying and the numerous Spatial Information disciplines. To this end the stream covers general scientific and IT principles, as well as specialised Surveying and Spatial Information topics. Specialisation is provided for through the provision of elective courses offered in the third and fourth years of the program and the choice of a targeted final year thesis project often aligned with an external industry partner. <br /><br />The degree of BE in Surveying is recognised by the Board of Surveying and Spatial Information of New South Wales as meeting the requirements for entry as a candidate to become a Registered Surveyor. The degree is also recognised by the Institution of Surveyors, New South Wales, the Spatial Sciences Institute and Engineers Australia, for admission as corporate members.<br /><br />Suggestions for course sequences consistent with timetabling and availability can be found on the School website The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimize the student&#39;s choice of courses. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.<br /><br /></p>",
