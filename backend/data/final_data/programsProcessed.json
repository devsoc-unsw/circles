        "overview": "Biotechnology can be defined as the use of various biological processes to make products and perform services. In biotechnology, living cells and biochemical macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA are applied in a rapidly expanding range of activities of direct benefit to society. Biotechnology is used for the production of pharmaceuticals, food and industrial chemicals, in the development of improved crops and livestock for farming, for environmental clean-up, and in forensics. Modern biotechnology makes practical use of the most recent scientific advances in areas such as molecular genetics and molecular cell biology.\n\nThe development of recombinant DNA technology has resulted in the ability to create, modify and improve industrial organisms and to produce large quantities of any useful protein. Based on this technology, biopharmaceuticals including hormones, vaccines, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-inflammatory agents and new therapies for the treatment of cancer are being developed with the potential to revolutionise medicine. The sequencing of the human genome and the rapid emergence of high-throughput genomic and proteomic techniques is resulting in a surge of new drug targets. Translation of this advanced knowledge into useful therapies and improved medical practices requires the application of biotechnology.\n\nMicroorganisms and viruses are being modified for use in controlling plant and animal diseases and pests. Diagnostic kits are being developed for use in forensic science and in product identification and quality control. Genetic improvements in agriculture, plants and animals are becoming a reality, as is the control of inborn genetic disorders in humans. The ability to treat diseased and injured organs with replacement cells and tissues generated outside of the body is advancing rapidly.\n\nThe future for expansion in all the above areas is immense. Our ability to cope with many medical, environmental, agricultural and manufacturing problems in the 21st century will depend heavily on advances in biotechnology.",

Please refer to previous editions of the handbook for pre-2024 requirements.\n\nThis double degree program offered by the Faculty of Science and UNSW Business School allows students to earn two degrees after five and a half years of successful study: a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Materials Science and Engineering, and a Bachelor of Commerce.\nThe program is designed for aspiring materials scientists or engineers who want to gain a deeper understanding of the economic and social aspects of their profession, as well as develop skills in technical management and professional leadership. It is expected that students enrolled in this program will advance to entrepreneurial and managerial roles.\nA full range of commerce and engineering careers remains available to those who successfully complete both components of this double degree. Many materials scientists and engineers advance into technical management roles, so this double degree program not only strengthens the commerce background but also provides essential engineering skills.\nIn addition, materials engineers are increasingly finding employment in the commercial sector, and the double degree program serves as a solid foundation for those entering fields such as banking, consultancy, or entrepreneurship. Students aspiring to pursue purely commercial careers will also benefit from the technical and numerate strengths acquired through the engineering program.",

Vision science includes the optics of lenses and instruments, the physiology of the eye, the psychophysics of vision and the neuroscience of the brain.\nOptometry includes the diagnosis and management of ocular disease, the dispensing of spectacles and contact lenses, the management of people with special needs (children, low vision), sports vision and vision in the workplace. Graduates of this program will be able to register as an optometrist in Australia. The degree is also recognised in New Zealand and in most parts of Asia. Job opportunities in this field are excellent and are expected to remain excellent given the high visual demands in the modern computer-based workplace, and the ageing population in Australia.\nUpon completion of the Master of Clinical Optometry degree, students will be allowed to apply for registration with the Optometry Board leading to the practice of Optometry in Australia, New Zealand and most parts of Asia.\nGraduates of the dual award Bachelor of Vision Science/Master of Clinical Optometry will have specialised knowledge and skills for professional practice and research in Optometry and Vision Science and further learning.\n\n\n\nAccreditations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program is accredited by the Optometry Council of Australia and New Zealand (OCANZ), the Optometry Board of Australia (OBA) and the Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians Board New Zealand (ODOB) for the purpose of registration in Australia and New Zealand.",

We consider the interior as a dynamic and open-ended conceptual space through which the human scale and experiences inherent in the private and public spaces of our urban environments can be interrogated and projected.\nThrough a focus on material and spatial assembly, agency and affect, we foster an agile and critical approach to design enquiry, underpinned by an informed appreciation of the environmental, cultural and historic contexts of interior architecture and design. We value an expansive approach in the speculation and projection of the contemporary interior, underpinned by rigour and creative risk taking.\nOur goal is to produce industry leaders with the ethical, collaborative and creative skills that will allow them to effectively respond to the multi-disciplinary, global demands inherent in the reshaping of our future interiorscapes.",

        "overview": "The Bachelor of City Planning (Hons) provides academic education and applied learning leading to professional, accredited qualifications in planning. The BCP (Hons) is a four-year, full-time, embedded honours program of study. The core courses develop and strengthen disciplinary foundations, and elective courses develop advanced and specific knowledge and skills. The program also incorporates a\npractice year\nof work integrated learning, with students developing skills in the workplace as well as the classroom. The final year of capstone projects involves opportunities to further pursue specialist areas of interest, through a plan-making studio and a research thesis.\nPlanning is a varied and progressive profession which plays a pivotal role in decisions shaping the future of cities and regions. Planners need to see the whole picture: we need to be good thinkers, good analysts and good communicators. We work with stakeholders across the spectrum of interests - from global developers to local communities - to foster feasible, equitable, sustainable and progressive outcomes. Working at the interface between development and environment, the planner&#39;s role involves collecting and analysing information, identifying needs and options, making forecasts, preparing policies, plans and programs for implementation, exercising development control, investigating development proposals, and evaluating results, communicating outcomes and consultation. Sydney and NSW provide a fantastic laboratory to help understand the crucial role played by planners in addressing complex challenges, systematically placed in its global context through critical analysis and drawing upon best practice.\nThe Bachelor of City Planning (Hons) aims to produce high quality graduates who have acquired UNSW Graduate attributes and are capable, through their skills, knowledge and experience, of undertaking a wide range of tasks required of a qualified planning practitioner. As well as preparing for the profession, a planning degree provides lifelong analytical, collaborate and communication skills much in demand more widely.",

You&#39;ll also learn about key institutions of criminal justice including the police, courts and prison, and the impact they have in the community. Key concerns include the nature of crime, how crime is defined and measured, why people commit crime and how societies might respond to crime and criminality.\nThe BCCJ is delivered via two core curricula, the Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice Core and the Social Science core, ensuring you will not only gain a comprehensive understanding of contemporary criminological issues, but also an in-depth training in the applied social research and policy skills required to translate this knowledge into practice.",

        "overview": "Psychology is a discipline of both scientific research and applied practice. As a science, psychology is concerned with the study of behaviour and its underlying mental and neural processes. Students gain an integrated and comprehensive education in main discipline areas, including developmental, social, cognitive, biological, physiological and abnormal psychology. The program also develops research methods skills. Psychology has many areas of cutting edge interdisciplinary research and application and students have an option to pursue individual interests, choosing electives from a range of specialist areas, including psychology and law; psychology and work; development disorders; psychopathology; health psychology, language, cognitive science, neuroscience and others.\nPsychology has many areas of application, especially in clinical, correctional, counselling, educational, and organisational settings. In addition, people with training in psychology pursue careers in academic research, health research, developmental disabilities and rehabilitation, ergonomics, occupational health and safety, personnel selection, training, and management, vocational guidance, and marketing.\nThe program allows students to complete an APAC-accredited undergraduate sequence in psychology across three years. The program is designed to allow students to complete a complementary major (in a related discipline where there is a professional and/or academic rationale that supports the proposed combination). Complementary majors available outside of the Faculty of Science include behavioural economics, marketing, human resource management, criminology, linguistics and philosophy. From the Faculty of Science, students may choose a complementary major in neuroscience or vision science. Upon completion of this program students may choose to complete an additional fourth year program in psychology (Honours), subject to satisfying the entry requirements (refer to the Pathways section).\nThe basic rules for the degree are set out under the Program Structure section of this Handbook. Students must ensure that they complete a minimum of 78 units of credit (UoC) in Psychology, a combination of PSYCxxxx core and PSYC3xxx elective courses (as defined under Program Structure). The remaining UoC may comprise of courses offered by the Faculty of Science or any other Faculty. Please consult the School of Psychology for detailed definitions of complementary majors and their appropriate program structures (refer to the Sample Programs section).",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 144 UOC when taken as a standalone program.\n1. At least 78 UOC of Psychology courses 2. 54 UOC of Free Electives (see Complementary majors, below) 3. 12 UOC General Education courses\nStudents who do not choose to complete a complementary major complete 54 UOC of Free Electives in total.\nIf a student uses their Free Electives to complete a complementary major, the remaining Free Elective UOC to be completed will vary depending on the major chosen, as follows.\nMajors in:\n\nLinguistics or Philosophy: 18 UOC of Free Electives.\nCriminology, Behavioural Economics, Human Resource Management or Marketing: 18 UOC of Free Electives.\nNeuroscience or Vision Science: 0 UOC of Free Electives.\n\nGEN# coded courses can only be used to fulfil the General Education requirement of the program (i.e., they cannot be used to fulfil the Free Elective requirement). Any exceptions to these rules must be approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) or nominee.",

PPE graduates globally are recognised leaders in all aspects of public life, including the highest reaches of government, political parties and lobby groups, the public service, NGOs, and social activist organisations. It also equips students for careers in banking, consultancy work, and strategic advising to major corporations. PPE graduates are also well known as public commentators on contemporary issues. The PPE will help you bring the perspectives of three crucial intellectual disciplines to pressing contemporary national and global issues such as justice, inequality and climate change. As well as combining a carefully chosen combination of existing courses from the Politics and International Relations, Philosophy, and Economics streams, the program will include courses specifically designed to enable you to explore the synergies and tensions between them and assess their relevance to meeting humanity&#39;s most difficult challenges.",

        "overview": "Economics is an influential social science that explores human behaviour and decision-making, with a focus on the roles played by incentives, resource constraints, laws, customs, and institutions. When you study the\nBachelor of Economics\nat UNSW, you ll explore how the decisions of institutions and individuals interact to determine outcomes for the economy and society.\nAs a graduate of economics, your distinct insights can be applied broadly. Through this degree, you&#39;ll gain highly transferable analytical skills that are valuable in a diverse range of careers.\nIn addition to more traditional economic issues like unemployment, taxation, and trade policy, economics allows you to understand and address human challenges like inequality, climate change, corruption, political polarisation, and impediments to education and health care.\n\n\n\nKey features\n\n\n\n\nLearn how to change the world\nYou ll explore and find solutions to the important issues of our time. Economics uncovers the forces behind global inequality and the drivers of international relations. It explores policymaking and regulation, inflation, property rights, labour markets, our interaction with the environment, firm organisation and competition, and strategic interaction.\n\nBecome highly sought after by industry and government\nUNSW Economics graduates are keenly sought after by policymakers at all levels of government, private sector employers, not-for-profits, and international organisations. They work in diverse careers as analysts, researchers, forecasters, journalists, and advisors.\n\nBuild your expertise\nOur flexible program allows you to shape your degree around your interests and goals. Choose from three specialisations in economics, build your own program, or complement your economics studies with other Business and Commerce courses. You can also study this program as a double degree to combine your expertise.\n\nPut theory into practice\nYou ll apply your academic learning through practical experience, empowering you to use economics and leadership to change the world. Opportunities for practical experience include internships, group consulting projects, and global practicums.",

Psychology has many areas of cutting edge interdisciplinary research and application and students have an option to pursue individual interests, choosing electives from a range of specialist areas, including psychology and law; psychology and work; development disorders; psychopathology; health psychology, language, cognitive science, neuroscience and others.\n\nPsychology has many areas of application, especially in clinical, correctional, counselling, educational, and organisational settings. In addition, people with training in psychology pursue careers in academic research, health research, developmental disabilities and rehabilitation, ergonomics, occupational health and safety, personnel selection, training, and management, vocational guidance, and marketing.\n\nIn the fourth year of the program, students conduct a year-long, 30 UOC major independent research project (completed under the guidance of an academic supervisor), and write a thesis based on the project. In addition, students complete 18 UOC of advanced-level core and elective coursework in both Term 1 and Term 2.\n\nThe research project may be undertaken in most areas of psychology including: psychopathology; behavioural neuroscience; cognitive science; cognition and perception; forensic psychology; and social, personality and developmental psychology. The project culminates in a written thesis, which is assessed independently by two academics (neither of which is the student&#39;s supervisor).\n\nThe coursework requirement includes content that encompasses history, professional ethics, evidence-based practice and advanced coverage of selected contemporary issues in psychology that reflect the expertise and research specialisations of School staff.",

Civil Engineers essentially engineer and manage the infrastructure of our built environment including buildings, bridges, roads and highways, tunnels, airfields, dams, ports and harbours, railways, new mines, water supply and sewerage schemes, irrigation systems and flood mitigation works.\n\nThe Civil Engineering with Architecture program provides for an appreciation of architectural principles and an understanding of both the architect&#39;s role in construction and the interaction between architects and engineers. The ultimate aim is to help students become conceptual thinkers, inspired by beautiful creations to build even better ones, to develop an appreciation for beauty with the mathematical ability to challenge the traditional boundaries of structural design. Students graduating from this degree will be well qualified to collaborate with architects and other professionals in the built environment to produce integrated and sustainable design. Creativity and inventiveness are the key attributes of this program.\n\nIn the final year of the program students may elect to major in structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, transport engineering, water engineering or engineering construction and management.\n\nThis program can be taken on a four-year full-time basis or on a part-time basis subject to the approval of the Head of School. Intending part-time students are advised that all courses are offered only in the daytime.",

This\ndouble degree\nwill allow interested students to complement their Actuarial Studies with business analytics.\n\nThe analytics skill set is one of the core sub-disciplines of the actuarial profession. The data analytics space is a rapidly evolving area with broad reaching applications. The advent of big data has led to an explosion in captured data, analytics approaches and businesses harnessing this data to create new industries or reinvent the way existing industries operate. Pursuing a joint program in Information Systems allows students to build up their business analytics skills. This will assist students to use modelling and data analysis techniques on large data sets to discover predictive patterns and relationships for business use. Solid skills in programming will also assist students during their actuarial career and actuarial employers report an unmet demand for candidates who have proficient business analytics skills.",

        "overview": "The dual Bachelor of Engineering Science/Bachelor of Science (3733) is a 4-year non-accredited pass degree that also serves as an exit degree for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)/Bachelor of Science (3767) program. As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering Science provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams.\nThe Bachelor of Science allows you to study a wide range of science subjects as well as many other areas of interest. This degree is ideal for students who seek a &#39;generalist&#39; degree in which there is a large element of choice. Students are encouraged to choose a broad range of courses in the first year, to expand their general understanding of Science which then enables them to choose from a wide selection of major options in the second and third year. The rules and requirements for the degree are set out below.",

Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering Science major and Science major there may be overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 192 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 192 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.\n\nCourse Substitutions\n\nDepending on the combination of Engineering Science major and Science major, you may need to take a specific Science course in place of the listed Engineering Science course (e.g. a more advanced Maths course). Please refer to the Engineering (Hons)/Science handbook page for a list of common substitutions.",

As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering Science provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams.\nThe Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) is a highly valued business qualification offering students a career-focused education for long term success. Students are empowered to become adaptive thinkers and drive purposeful change to thrive in a fast-changing world.\nA unique feature of the BCom is the Integrated First Year, where students learn about business management and the broader environment in which an organisation operates, with a strong focus on developing professional skills and capabilities.\nIn this flexible, diverse and comprehensive business degree, students have exclusive access to Career Accelerator\nan impressive suite of career-boosting opportunities. Completion of at least one for-credit Career Accelerator course is a signature feature of the BCom.\n\nStudents complete up to two majors, selecting from a comprehensive and industry advised suite, including Accounting, Business Analytics, Economics, Finance, FinTech, HR, Information Systems, International Business, Marketing and Taxation, many fulfilling professional accreditation requirements.\nThe myBCom Series, designed in collaboration with industry and alumni, guides students to develop a personalised roadmap to get the full benefit of the curricular and co-curricular opportunities offered in the BCom. Students graduate with their personal digital myBCom Graduate Portfolio, showcasing their academic, technical and practical career-ready skills and capabilities for a fulfilling career.",

As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.\n\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering Science provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams.\n\n\nThe Bachelor of Computer Science involves the study of the design, construction and uses of computer systems. It is concerned with the representation of data and data structures in computer systems and the design of algorithms for automatic manipulation of this information by programming languages and machine systems. It is very much concerned with the design and development of hardware and software tools by which computer applications may be developed, but not so much with the applications themselves. It is, however, noted that non-computing elements (such as human interface or psychological aspects) can often dictate the level of success of computing systems. At UNSW, particular emphasis is given to comprehension of the basic principles behind computing tools, operating systems, compilers and translators, and computer hardware.",

These can be used to take Engineering or non-Engineering courses. Students take these free electives with 12 UOC freed up from overlapping courses. The set of overlapping courses varies depending on the combination of Engineering Science major and Computer Science major.\nDepending on the chosen combination of Engineering Science major and Computer Science major there may be additional overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 192 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses (on top of the required 12 UOC of Free Electives) to bring the total to 192 UOC. Students must take these additional electives from Faculty of Engineering and/or School of Computer Science.\nStudents MUST take COMP1511 as their first year Engineering Science computing course.",

Students should seek advice from the School of Mathematics regarding their Advanced Mathematics(Honours) program, and the relevant Engineering School Office, or the Faculty of Engineering regarding their Engineering program.",

A 168 UOC Engineering stream consisting of the following:\n\n\nAt least 48 UOC Disciplinary Knowledge and Enquiry-based Courses\n30-42UOC Introductory Knowledge core courses\nAt least 12 UOC of elective courses\nThe balance of stream to consist of Foundation Disciplinary Knowledge Courses\n\n2. Students must also complete at least 60 days of approved Industrial Training experience.\nBachelor of Advanced Mathematics (Honours) (144 UOC)\n\nAn approved Advanced Mathematics (Honours) major and\nSCIF1131;\n48 units of credit Honours Year; and\nScience elective courses\n\nIn this dual degree students take 168 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons), and 144 UOC for the Bachelor of Advanced Mathematics (Hons), for a total of 312 UOC. Because the Science courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the dual degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 288 UOC. Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering stream and Advanced Mathematics major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 288 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 288 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.\n\nIn some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically,\n\nStudents completing a Vision Science major count DESN1000 in place of SCIF1131\nStudents completing a Maths major should replace the upper level math course in Engineering as follows:\nCivil Engineering: CVEN2002 or CVEN2702 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nMechatronic Engineering: MATH2089 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nElectrical Engineering: MATH2069 - replace with MATH2011 and MATH2521 or higher versions, and MATH2099 -- replace with MATH2501 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nSoftware Engineering: MATH2859 + MATH2400 - replace with (MATH2801 or MATH2901) and MATH3411",

Students should seek advice from the Faculty of Science regarding their Advanced Science (Honours) program, and the relevant Engineering School Office, or the Faculty of Engineering, regarding their Engineering program.",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 288 UOC (after the 24 UOC reduction from double counted courses).\nBachelor of Engineering (Honours) (168 UOC)\n1. A 168 UOC Engineering stream consisting of the following:\n\n\nAt least 48 UOC Disciplinary Knowledge and Enquiry-based Courses\n30-42 UOC Introductory Knowledge core courses\nAt least 12 UOC of elective courses\nThe balance of stream to consist of Foundation Disciplinary Knowledge Courses\n\n2. Students must also complete at least 60 days of approved Industrial Training experience.\nBachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) (144 UOC)\n\nAn approved Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) major; and\n48 units of credit Honours Year; and\nScience elective courses\n\nIn this dual degree students take 168 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons), and 144 UOC for the Bachelor of Advanced Science (Hons), for a total of 312 UOC. Because the Science courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the dual degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 288 UOC. Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering stream and Advanced Science major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 288 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 288 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.\n\nIn some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically,\n\nStudents completing a Vision Science major count DESN1000 in place of SCIF1131\nStudents completing a Maths major should replace the upper level math course in Engineering as follows:\nCivil Engineering: CVEN2002 or CVEN2702 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nMechatronic Engineering: MATH2089 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nElectrical Engineering: MATH2069 - replace with MATH2011 and MATH2521 or higher versions, and MATH2099 -- replace with MATH2501 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nSoftware Engineering: MATH2859 + MATH2400 - replace with (MATH2801 or MATH2901) and MATH3411",

Because the Science courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the dual degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 240 UOC. Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering stream and Science major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 240 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.\n\nIn some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically,\n\nStudents completing a Vision Science major count DESN1000 in place of SCIF1131\nStudents completing a Maths major should replace the upper level math course in Engineering as follows:\nCivil Engineering: CVEN2002 or CVEN2702 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nMechatronic Engineering: MATH2089 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nElectrical Engineering: MATH2069 - replace with MATH2011 and MATH2521 or higher versions, and MATH2099 -- replace with MATH2501 and MATH2801 or higher versions\nSoftware Engineering: MATH2859 + MATH2400 - replace with (MATH2801 or MATH2901) and MATH3411",

The typical duration of this program is 5 years full-time.\nThe Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) is the degree of choice for innovative thinkers with exceptional scientific knowledge and skills. It&#39;s designed for talented students and offers the flexibility to tailor the degree in a way that works for them. The degree offers students access to advanced level courses and includes an Honours year.\nThe Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) focuses on the design and development of hardware and software tool by which computer applications may be developed. By combining your passion for science and the computer sciences you could further develop applications for use within the scientific world.",

The Science courses required for both degrees can overlap. Depending on the chosen combination of Computer Science major and Advanced Science (Honours) major there may be varying amounts of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 240 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.\nIn some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically:\n\n- Students must complete MATH1141 and MATH1241 or higher versions.",

Students must take these additional Electives from Faculty of Engineering and/or the School of Computer Science.\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, when a course overlaps the student must replace the required course in one program with a more advanced course required in the other program. For example-\n\n\n1. Students MUST take COMP1511 as a Level 1 Core Course, COMP1511 is then double counted towards both degrees.\n2. Students are required to complete one of MATH1131 or MATH1141, and one of MATH1231 or MATH1241. The two Maths course are double counted towards both degrees.\n3. MATH1081 is a core requirement Bachelor of Computer Science but is replaced by the 2nd Year Math course taken in the BE(Hons) Major.\n\n\n\nNote: Without following the substitutions above, students may need to take more than 240 UOC to complete the double degree.",

The Science Faculty section in this Handbook describes the Science options and the School of Computer Science and Engineering Student Office can supply sample programs indicating what previous students have arranged.\nIn addition to the BSc in Computer Science program 3778, students must complete a minimum of 96 units of credit in Science courses, including a major sequence in an approved area. The Science office must approve the Science component while the School of Computer Science and Engineering will approve the final program and schedule.",

The Science courses required for both degrees can overlap. Depending on the chosen combination of Computer Science major and Science major, there may be varying amounts of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 192 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 192 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.",

        "overview": "As a science, psychology researchers are concerned with the study of behaviour and its underlying mental and neural processes. Criminological scholars investigate a broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, policing, state crime, alternative justice systems, criminalisation and regulation. Taken together, students completing the B Psychology (Honours) / B Criminology and Criminal Justice dual will be equipped with an interdisciplinary knowledge base and skill set that will open a myriad of career pathways and opportunities.\nPsychology is a discipline of both scientific research and applied practice. Topics of study include learning, memory, cognition, perception, motivation, life-span development, personality, social interactions, and abnormal psychology. The program also develops research methods and data analysis skills. Psychology has many areas of cutting-edge interdisciplinary research and application and students have an option to pursue individual interests, choosing electives from a range of specialist areas, including psychology and law; psychology and work; developmental disorders; psychopathology; health psychology, language, cognitive science, neuroscience and others.\nPsychology also has many areas of application, especially in clinical, correctional, counselling, educational, and organisational settings. In addition, people with training in psychology pursue careers in academic research, health research, developmental disabilities and rehabilitation, ergonomics, occupational health and safety, personnel selection, training and management, vocational guidance, and marketing.\nAcross the first three years of the program, students to complete an APAC-accredited undergraduate sequence in psychology. In the fourth year of the program, students conduct a year-long, 30 UOC major independent research project (completed under the guidance of an academic supervisor), and write a thesis based on the project. The research project may be undertaken in most areas of psychology including: psychopathology; behavioural neuroscience; cognitive science; cognition and perception; forensic psychology; and social, personality and developmental psychology. The project culminates in a written thesis, which is assessed independently by two academics (neither of which is the student&#39;s supervisor). In addition, students complete 18 UOC of advanced-level core and elective coursework in both Term 1 and Term 2.\nThe Bachelor of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice (BCCJ) is an innovative and interdisciplinary field of study with a real-world focus designed to give students opportunities to explore interests in crime, deviance, social control and the legal system. Criminology is shaped by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, and other interdisciplinary fields including history, politics, economics, architecture, and cultural studies. Key concerns include the nature of crime, how crime is defined and measured, why people commit crime and how societies might respond. In the BCCJ program, students have the opportunity to tackle present day social problems including victimisation, juvenile justice, drug-related harm, community safety, Indigenous justice, environmental harm and state crime. In addition, students have a number of opportunities to explore career pathways through our work-integrated learning placement course and final year core offerings, which focus on the application of criminological knowledge to pressing criminological concerns. The UNSW BCCJ also provides students with in-depth training in the applied social research and policy skills required to translate this knowledge into practice.\nThe Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) / Bachelor of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice dual is a 5-year program (full-time).",

        "overview": "Psychology is concerned with the scientific study of behaviour and its underlying mental and neural processes. Criminology is concerned with broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, policing, state crime, alternative justice systems, criminalisation and regulation. Taken together, students completing the B Psychological Science / B Criminology and Criminal Justice dual will be equipped with an interdisciplinary knowledge base and skill set that will open a myriad of career pathways and opportunities.\nPsychology is a discipline of both scientific research and applied practice. Students in the Bachelor of Psychological Science program gain an integrated and comprehensive education in main discipline areas, including developmental, social, cognitive, biological, physiological and abnormal psychology. The program also develops research methods and data analysis skills. Psychology has many areas of cutting-edge interdisciplinary research and students have an option to pursue individual interests, choosing electives from a range of specialist areas, including psychology and law; psychology and work; development disorders; psychopathology; health psychology, language, cognitive science, neuroscience and others.\nPsychology has many areas of application, especially in clinical, correctional, counselling, educational, and organisational settings. In addition, people with training in psychology pursue careers in academic research, health research, developmental disabilities and rehabilitation, ergonomics, occupational health and safety, personnel selection, training, and management, vocational guidance, and marketing.\nThe program allows students to complete an APAC-accredited undergraduate sequence in psychology. Upon completion of this program students may choose to complete an additional fourth year program in psychology (Honours), subject to satisfying the entry requirements.\nThe Bachelor of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice (BCCJ) is an innovative and interdisciplinary field of study with a real-world focus designed to give students the opportunity to explore interests in crime, deviance, social control and the legal system. Key concerns include the nature of crime, how crime is defined and measured, why people commit crime and how societies might respond. Within the BCCJ program, students have the opportunity to tackle present day social problems including victimisation, juvenile justice, drug-related harm, community safety, Indigenous justice, environmental harm and state crime. Criminology is shaped by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, and other interdisciplinary fields including history, politics, economics, architecture, and cultural studies. The UNSW BCCJ also provides students with in-depth training in the applied social research and policy skills required to translate this knowledge into practice.\nThe Bachelor of Psychological Science / Bachelor of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice is a 4-year program (full-time). The Psychological Science program allows students to complete an accredited Psychology degree with the option to apply for an additional Honours Year in Psychology through 4518 Psychological Science (Honours).",

        "overview": "UNSW Medicine offers a six year integrated Medicine program (288 UOC) which leads to the awards of Bachelor of Medical Studies (BMed) and Doctor of Medicine (MD).\n\nThe program includes a compulsory Independent Learning Project (30 UOC) to ensure that all graduates acquire knowledge of research principles and methods applicable to Medicine and its professional practice.\n\nThe objectives of the Medicine program are:\n\n\nTo establish an integrated, interconnected and organised medical knowledge base as a platform for a professional and personal life of learning through experience.\nTo develop effective interactions with oneself through reflection; interaction with others through communication; and interaction with information and learning resources through information literacy and critical analysis.\nTo develop a set of personal attributes and skills appropriate to the professional practice of Medicine.\n\n\nThe program is organised into two degrees:\n\n\nBachelor of Medical Studies (BMed)\n\n\nThe BMed includes Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 commences with the Foundations course, followed by 7 x 8 week courses focussing on basic medical sciences in relation to the human life cycle; social, ethical and legal issues related to health care; and early experience in clinical or other health-related environments. During this phase, students will undertake a variety of learning activities involving students from different stages of the program working collaboratively in small groups.\n\nPhase 2 consists of 2 x 16-week courses, with increased clinical content and an emphasis on correlation between prior and current learning.\n\n\nDoctor of Medicine (MD)\n\n\nThe MD includes the Independent Learning Project (ILP), followed by a Clinical Transition Course prior to the Phase 3 courses. During the Independent Learning Project students should also complete 12 UOC of General Education courses in a faculty or faculties other than Medicine.\n\nPhase 3 consists of 10 x 8-week courses with a clinical focus, but still includes relevant content from the basic medical sciences and the social sciences. Students are required to complete a course in the disciplines of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Psychiatry, Primary Care, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Children&#39;s Health (Paediatrics). Students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete Phase 3 requirements. In addition, a student&#39;s clinical experiences during Phase 3 must include a minimum of 4 weeks in a rural location. All clinical courses in Phase 3 adopt the principles of clinical clerkship, in which students learn through experience and participation in the treatment of patients under the care of medical practitioners and/or medical teams to which they are attached.\n\nStudents who have achieved a high standard in the BMed may undertake a one year program of supervised research leading to the award of the BSc(Med) Honours. Students wishing to undertake a full year of research may be able to enrol in the BSc (Med) Honours program 3831 subject to the approval from the Honours Committee. These students will be exempt from undertaking the Independent Learning Project. Exemption from the Independent Learning Project will also be granted to students who have previously completed a research Honours program or higher research degree, or a Master degree with a significant research component, or who can otherwise demonstrate acceptable evidence of independent study or research at a tertiary level.",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 288 UOC when taken as a standalone program.\nThe duration of the integrated Medicine program is normally 6 years. It has a modular structure comprising a series of fully integrated courses studied over 26 teaching periods, generally each of 8 weeks duration. There are 4 teaching periods in Years 1-4 approximating the University semester timetable. There is an additional teaching period (Summer Teaching Period) in years 5-6. In most years, the standard UNSW program load of 48 UOC per year will apply.",

The first option enables students to undertake a coursework intensive program that will reduce the research project to 18 UoC allowing 30 UoC to be undertaken via coursework, from an approved specialisation. The second option is Extended Research and students will select a research project (36 UoC) that aligns with one of our specialisations and 12 UoC derived from coursework.\nThis is a one year research program offered to students in year 4 of the six year Medicine program or Arts/Medicine who have achieved a high standard in their studies. Those who complete the research program in conjunction with the six year curriculum will be eligible for the award of the degree BSc(Med)Hons.\nIn general the aims of the year, normally spent in supervised research, are to enable the student to acquire an appreciation of the value of observation and research in the development of medical science, to determine the &#39;current state of knowledge&#39; in a defined field, to provide experience in the written and spoken presentation of scientific information and scholarly research, and to provide an invaluable background in basic research philosophy and techniques on which a subsequent career in specialised medical research may be built, and develop an understanding of, and ability to interpret research that underpins evidenced-based clinical practice.",

        "overview": "Some health issues, like obesity and diabetes, road safety, environmental health, mental health, and infectious diseases, are too widespread to be solved individually. To address these issues, public health professionals work to prevent diseases, promote healthy behaviour, and address health inequalities within different groups of people.\nPublic health professionals are responsible for analysing health data, designing policies or implementing programs, and collaborating with diverse stakeholders, including government agencies, non-profit organizations, and healthcare providers.\nWith the Bachelor of Public Health (BPH), you&#39;ll gain a deep understanding of the critical issues impacting population health and ways to reduce inequalities in diverse local, national, and global settings.\n\nPublic health graduates work in various roles and organisations. You may work as an epidemiologist, health educator, health policy advisor, biostatistician, environmental health specialist, or health promotion officer to address and improve public health outcomes.\nLocal and international students can find work in Australia and overseas, depending on their area of focus. You may work in non-government organisations such as international health agencies (World Health Organisation), Government-affiliated organisations such as hospitals or government (local, state, and federal), universities, research institutes, or private companies.\nThe degree aims to support students in developing the in-demand job skills needed to design, develop, and implement public health solutions and ensure their social impact. Students will be exposed to various case studies spanning international contexts, population health issues, and priorities.\nBy joining our program, you&#39;ll delve into diverse topics such as epidemiology, policy development and leadership, environmental health, health promotion, and infectious diseases. Through hands-on learning experiences, internships, and research opportunities, you&#39;ll gain valuable insights into real-world public health challenges and develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary to address them effectively.\nReady to embark on an exciting journey to improve global health and make a real difference? This three-year degree can be completed on campus in Sydney or partially or fully online at a relaxed pace, allowing you to fit your studies around your other commitments. The degree covers the scope and methods of public health research and interventions. It prepares students to design and implement new public health approaches for emerging health problems.\nA highlight of the degree is the Capstone course, which allows students to apply the public health knowledge and skills gained from their courses to a research project, internship, or public health study abroad tour.",

Artists, musicians, and scientists approach creativity, exploration and research in different but increasingly connected ways and perspectives; when working together they open up new ways of seeing, experiencing and interpreting the world around us.\nThis double degree program enables students to complete a Major sequence from those available in the Bachelor of Science and complete a Bachelor of Fine Arts, where students can study a wide range of fine art, music, and media art disciplines.\nThe typical duration of this program is 4 years full-time. For admission to the program, students must satisfy the entry requirements to both the Bachelor of Science (3970) and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (4830) programs.\nFor questions regarding the requirements for the program, students should consult staff in the the Nucleus Student Hub.",

In recognition of the dynamically evolving sector in emerging technology, and an exponential growth in the use of drones or remotely piloted aircraft, UNSW Aviation has introduced the Bachelor of Aviation in Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) to continue supporting their students to become leaders in the aviation industry.\n\nThe opportunities and dynamic nature of the RPAS industry are evident in the vast array of applications and operations that integrate the use of RPAS including emergency services, defence, humanitarian aid, photogrammetry and surveying, medical and disaster relief, retail and supply chain, entertainment, conservation biology, and health and safety management. To be industry-ready and prepared to confidently approach a variety of aviation industry challenges, the program has been designed to provide students with a combination of core knowledge, transferrable skills, and real-life experience in operating and managing RPAS.\nUnique to the Bachelor of Aviation in RPAS is the integration of RPAS-specific flight hours, including visual line of sight and beyond visual line of sight training conducted in collaboration with a leading RPAS industry partner. In addition, students will undertake courses in drone programming, information systems and operations management. The program shares a common core with the flying program with students developing traditional aviation skills through the completion of a Recreational Pilot&#39;s Licence (RPL).\nOther key areas of learning include aviation data analytics, safety management, aeronautical knowledge, meteorology, human factors, air law, navigation, and instrument rating, as well as strategic communication and scientific skills, which are shared with the management program. Students will learn key skills and knowledge to embark on a successful career in the RPAS industry, whether it is to create a start-up business, or to fulfill the demands of highly skilled roles within organisations, such as Chief Remote Pilot, Drone Missions Commander, UAV Supervisor, and Drone Operations Manager.\n\nFor successful fulfillment of the Bachelor of Aviation in Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems program requirements, students will have completed up to 40 crewed flight hours and up to 40 uncrewed flight hours with a range of multi-rotor and fixed-wing equipment, and acquire a respective Recreational Pilot&#39;s Licence (RPL) and Remote Pilot Licence (RePL).\n\n\n*Note : Due to the block training nature of the flight training program, teaching periods might not correspond to standard academic sessions, and students will need to undertake the Professional Pilot Program (flying training) on a full-time basis.",

This is a program designed for talented students and offers the flexibility to tailor the degree in a way that works for them. The degree offers students access to advanced level courses and includes an Honours year. Students will study foundation courses, which may include areas such as biology, chemistry, physics and maths, before choosing a major and really exploring what inspires them most. In their fourth year, students undertake Honours which involves a supervised research project and in some cases, advanced coursework. Outstanding Honours students may continue their studies in a higher research degree.",

Mgmt. will need to be able to place their understanding of the scientific aspects of the environment within the general context of the policy and legal framework of environmental regulations, as well as economic and social dimensions to environmental policy and management. The B. Env. Mgmt. is designed as a 3 year (full-time) program. There is also an opportunity for students to continue onto an Honours year in Program 4500 Science (Honours), if they satisfy the entry requirements (usually a Credit WAM) or to combine the B. Env. Mgmt. with the\nMasters of Environmental Management\n(Program 8623).",

        "overview": "The 3980 Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) program is a 144 UOC undergraduate program offered by UNSW Aviation through the Faculty of Science and resides within a suite of undergraduate aviation programs under UNSW Aviation, including the Bachelor of Aviation (Management) and the Bachelor of Aviation (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems).\nExplore the science behind aviation, earn your flying licences and get ready to take on global opportunities within the aviation sector. This degree not only educates and trains pilots to the highest commercial standards, it also develops future industry leaders and managers.\nThe aim of this program is to prepare students for a successful piloting career in aviation as well as future industry leaders and managers both domestically and globally.\nThe program focuses on skills and knowledge needed to become a professional pilot working either as a single pilot in a general aviation organisation, or as a multi-crew team in an airline. The Flying program includes flight training to a minimum level of Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), Instrument Rating - Multi Engine Aeroplane and Air Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) theory subject, which are directly managed and delivered through the UNSW Aviation Flying Operations Unit at Bankstown Airport. Students can enhance their aviation skills further with electives that include Instructor Rating and aviation research.\nAviation management areas include Human Factors and Safety, Airworthiness Management, Commercial Operations, Resource Management, Airline Management and Aviation Economics. Students also have the opportunity to develop research, critical thinking and analysis skills that underpin the program and enable them to be industry ready and confidently approach challenges in aviation.\nThe program has been designed by UNSW Academics and key aviation industry partners and provides students with an opportunity to gain real-world experience, which includes being directly mentored by professional pilots in the industry. In addition, Bachelor of Aviation in Flying students also have the opportunity to kickstart their flying careers through optional involvement in the Qantas Future Pilot Program (QFPP). The Program involves being mentored by experienced QantasLink pilots and provides a pathway to QantasLink that requires less than the minimum hours required for direct entry as a first officer. The QFPP is open to domestic and international students in the Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) program, with the potential for employment opportunities for those with the ability to work in Australia.\nThe program involves a minimum of 3 years of full-time study. The rules and requirements of the degree are set out below.\n*Note: Due to the block training nature of the flight training program, teaching periods might not correspond to standard academic sessions, and students will need to undertake the Professional Pilot Program (flying training) on a full-time basis.",

Students must follow the Handbook of the year they commenced their program, so continuing students should refer to the past edition Handbook\nhere .\nThe Bachelor of Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) is a professionally oriented, truly interdisciplinary program taught as a joint initiative between the Schools of Chemistry and Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences (Faculty of Science), and the Pharmacology section of the School of Biomedical Sciences (Faculty of Medicine).\nMedicinal Chemistry is an exciting, rapidly-expanding area within the broad discipline of Chemistry that has seen enormous growth recently both within Australia and globally. It is, quite simply, the development of new pharmaceutical agents, from Concept to Clinic. Many different stages are involved; from the design and synthesis of novel drug candidates, to their biochemical effects, testing regimes and regulatory and ethical considerations. The Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) program has been designed to ensure that graduates have a strong background in contemporary biology, biochemistry and pharmacology, based upon a solid foundation of essential chemistry.\nGraduates from the Medicinal Chemistry(Honours) program are equipped with a unique and wide harmony of skills, ranging from fundamental chemistry enabling the synthesis and analysis of drug candidates, through to relevant pharmacology and molecular biology skills. This combination means graduates are in high demand both locally and globally in pharmaceutical companies involved in modern drug design. In addition, the multidisciplinary nature of the program means that graduates are highly marketable within other science-based industries and related fields. The research focus in the Honours year, which provides projects that emphasise the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the area also enables students to progress seamlessly into a higher degree if they wish.\nGraduates obtain a broad education across a range of relevant scientific areas, as well as a strong grounding in advanced biological and chemical techniques. There is a particular emphasis on the medical sciences. The first year of the program provides solid foundation knowledge in some fundamental areas of science, chemistry, mathematics, and biology- as well as specific graduate attributes courses. Years two and three focus on chemistry, pharmacology, and biochemistry, with a number of recommended electives to broaden a student&#39;s knowledge in relevant fields (physiology, anatomy, genetics). The fourth (Honours) year provides a substantial research experience.",

        "overview": "The Bachelor of Education (Primary) (Honours) is an undergraduate initial teacher education program developed in partnership with the New South Wales Education Standards Authority.\nThe inclusion of an embedded honours track, along with specialisations in English and Mathematics, reflects the nexus between high expectations in initial teacher education and the provision of high quality, inspirational teachers in primary schools in this program.\n\nThere is an emphasis on applying the latest research into evidence-based practice and ensuring our staff model the use of the most up-to-date technologies and approaches to curriculum. The program addresses contemporary and emerging developments in education, curriculum requirements, community expectations, and our local and national employer needs and workforce demands.\n\nThe embedded honours provides students opportunity to extend interests developed in their specialist area of education (e.g., English, Mathematics, or in an alternative area of interest within primary education) by undertaking a self-directed minor thesis, supported by a supervising academic. The honours thesis must demonstrate synthesis and application of knowledge and skills developed in coursework components of their program either in English or Mathematics, which supports a teaching specialisation, or in an alternate area of interest.\nStudents develop a proposal for educational research in a research methods course in university term 1 of year 3. In year 4 they apply their knowledge of research methodologies to implement this proposal in the form of a thesis.\n\nThe program will be accredited by the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA), enabling graduates to teach in both government and non-government primary schools in all states of Australia and overseas. The program supports students to meet the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at graduate level.\nAcademic lecturers and local teachers with experience in primary education work together to provide core education courses and discipline-specific curriculum and pedagogy studies within the six key learning areas of the primary curriculum:\n\n\nEnglish\nMathematics\nScience and Technology\nHistory and Geography\nCreative Arts\nPersonal Development, Health and Physical Education\n\nThe journey to becoming a graduate teacher is enriched through the dynamic interaction of practice and theory through school-based experiences during the program. Students engage in an integrated program of discipline studies, educational studies and time in schools in years 2, 3 and 4. They engage in in-school experiences in year one. The third year includes a four-week block of professional experience (practicum) in university term three where they teach their first whole-class lessons under the careful supervision and scaffolding provided by an expert supervising teacher. This solid block of professional experience is a great foundation to their coursework and deeper research-oriented investigations in Year 4. Their professional learning journey culminates in the fourth year with a nine-week block of professional experience (practicum) at a different school complemented by the completion of a Graduate Teacher Performance Assessment designed so that pre-service teachers can demonstrate their readiness for the classroom at Graduate level.\n\nThis program is available face-to-face or distance (online with some face-to-face, i.e. multimodal). Should you need to pursue the entire program fully online, please reach out to the School to address your study plan needs:\neducation&#64;unsw.edu.au.\nFully online mode is only available to domestic students and students not on an international student visa.",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 192 UOC.\nThe program consists of 24 compulsory courses, including six core education courses (36 UOC), seven discipline courses (42 UOC), nine curriculum and pedagogy courses (54 UOC), two 6 UOC professional experience placements and a 12 UOC internship (24 UOC), and three Research/thesis courses (24 UOC). In each year of study students complete 48 UOC in a trimester arrangement. They also complete two General Education courses (12 UOC).\nThe program includes an embedded honours track. All students enrolling in the program will complete an honours thesis.\nProgression to Honours is based on the achievement of 75+ WAM by the end of year 2 of the program. Students will also be required to complete a research methods course (6 UOC) in year 3 at credit level or above. In addition to this requirement, students will complete a further two thesis courses which support the development and writing of the thesis (6 UOC + 12 UOC = 18 UOC). If the honours thesis addresses English or Mathematics, their honours will be recognised as an English or Mathematics Specialisation as per AITSL and NESA designations. They will be awarded a Bachelor of Education (Primary) (Honours).\nStudents who do not achieve a 75+ WAM by the end of their second year (or equivalent UOC) will be transferred into the Bachelor of Education (Primary) Award (4072). Students will then have the option to complete a two course teaching specialisation in Mathematics or English (12 UOC) as per AITSL and NESA designations in addition to one Education Elective (6 UOC) totalling 18 UOC, OR, complete three Education Electives (18 UOC) without a teaching specialisation.",

All Arts disciplines teach students to develop their capacity for critical analysis and argument as well as an awareness of the value of language as a political, intellectual, creative and communicative tool.\nStudents can combine courses from Business, Indo-Pacific Studies, Geography, History, and International and Political Studies, building expertise in one or more of these disciplines.\nThe objective of a Bachelor of Arts program is to stimulate students intellectually and to immerse them in the discipline of learning.\nThe program will develop graduate attributes, such as strong written and oral communications skills, the capacity to research, criticise and reflect, and the ability to work independently and collaboratively.\nHonours students who are RAN midshipmen or RAAF officer cadets continue with their programs at UNSW, Canberra and complete their degrees at the end of the fourth year. Army officer cadets transfer to the Royal Military College, Duntroon at the end of their third year. After completing a year of military training, they are commissioned as lieutenants, and those who are continuing with Honours programs return to the Academy to complete their Honours degree.",

        "overview": "The Bachelor of Science is a three-year program at pass level. A separate four-year program at Honours level (Program Code 4513) is also available for eligible applicants.\n\nScience is the understanding of the physical universe (from sub-atomic particles and microbes through to the planet s environment and the origin of the universe itself), and human interactions with it. Just as important is the scientific process by which this understanding is gained. In turn, Science is the foundation of the modern technologies that enhance the quality of lives and provide ever more sophisticated means of applying the scientific process. In addition, Science is crucial in control of disease, biotechnology, new sustainable energy sources, information technology, and management of precious natural resources.\n\nPass-level students in Science should complete their programs within three years. Honours students who are RAN midshipmen or RAAF officer cadets continue with their programs at UNSW Canberra at ADFA and complete their programs at the end of the fourth year. Army officer cadets, however, at the end of the third year transfer to the Royal Military College, Duntroon. After completing a year of military training they are commissioned as lieutenants and those who are continuing with Honours return to the Academy to complete their program.\n\nA Bachelor of Science program will develop students\nlifetime skills including creativity, problem-solving ability, critical thinking and communication skills that will be useful not only in a scientific environment but in all professions. It will prepare students to deal with technical and management issues that will often require scientific knowledge and the intellectual and practical problem-solving skills developed through studies in physical, environmental and mathematical sciences, and information technology.",

        "overview": "Engineering technology degrees within UNSW Canberra provide outstanding technology education to the future leaders of the Australian Defence Force and encourage excellence through contributions to the engineering profession, industry and community.\nStudents holding a Bachelor of Technology in the Aeronautical Engineering program may, under normal circumstances, articulate to the Bachelor of Engineering in the Aeronautical Engineering program with 12 months of additional study.\nThis three-year technology program at UNSW Canberra is accredited by Engineers Australia at the Engineering Technologist level.\nThe BTech (Aero) program is organised into streams developed for basic science/engineering principles and moving into specialised applications over three years. These streams include: foundation science, engineering technology, materials and structures, dynamics and control, thermofluids, design and management as well as discipline-specific streams such as aircraft systems and engines.\nExcept for Electrical Engineering and those in the Chief of Defence Force Students Program, first year technology and engineering students enrol in a common program taking foundation science and engineering courses. In the second and third year, the programs diverge into their specialities although there are some courses that span across programs in all years. A key element in all years is the design stream which emphasises complex problem-solving. Other streams such as aerodynamics, stability, control. thermofluids, structures, mechanics, materials and management often incorporate project-based learning informed by academic research and industrial practice. Electives and a final semester project enable students to pursue particular interests both within and outside the specialist discipline.\nAt the end of the program, students are expected to meet the graduate attributes of the University and Stage 1 Competencies of Engineers Australia, ready to practice in their chosen profession and with the ingenuity and resourcefulness to meet rapid technological change.\nThe BTech (Aero) is primarily designed for officer cadets and midshipmen of the Australian Defence Force who intend to become aircrew and wish to enhance their understanding of the operation and performance of aircraft. It is differentiated from the BTech (Aviation) program by providing a broader engineering technology foundation.",

All programs also include discipline-specific research projects. The research projects will be supervised by academic staff from the relevant discipline. With the approval of the relevant Heads of Schools, multi- or cross disciplinary projects may be undertaken.\nStudents in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. Final assessment will be based on a written paper or report and oral presentations.\nThroughout the program, and in addition to completing the courses given in the following schedules, students will be engaged with cohort activities so as to develop and maintain their interest and continuing involvement in the program via invited lectures, seminars, general reading and social events.\nEach of the CDFS Programs has objectives and learning outcomes in common with the standard Bachelor degree in the same area, but extends the educational principles embodied in the standard degree to a higher level. In the programs, students will be exposed to courses in critical analysis and/or research methods in the discipline(s) of their chosen program, which will offer significant extensions to the ideas and analysis normally available in the standard degree program. This will allow all CDFS to successfully undertake research-oriented courses at the appropriate level through their program, thereby integrating research into their studies in a way that is not available in the standard degree. The individual projects undertaken in close association with academic staff on research topics of mutual interest underpin the CDFS Programs and give students the ability to develop their full potential.",

All programs also include discipline-specific research projects. The research projects will be supervised by academic staff from the relevant discipline. With the approval of the Head of School, multi- or cross-disciplinary projects may be undertaken. Students in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. Final assessment will be based on a written paper or report and oral presentations.\nThroughout the program, and in addition to completing the courses given in the following schedules, students will be engaged with cohort activities so as to develop and maintain their interest and continuing involvement in the program via invited lectures, seminars, general reading and social events.\nThe CDFS Program has objectives and learning outcomes in common with the standard Bachelor of Business degree, but extends the educational principles embodied in the standard degree to a higher level. In the program, students will be exposed to courses in critical analysis and/or research methods, which will offer significant extension to the ideas and analysis normally available in the standard degree program. This will allow all CDFS to successfully undertake research-oriented courses at the appropriate level through their program, thereby integrating research into their studies in a way that is not available in the standard degree.

        "overview": "The Chief of Defence Force Students Program in Engineering offers the opportunity for students entering UNSW Canberra with a high Entrance Rank, and who maintain a high level of performance in their studies, to undertake research in a range of disciplines that will develop their critical thinking and independent research skills beyond that available in the standard Engineering program.\nIn Year 1 of the program, students will be engaged with cohort activities so as to develop and maintain their interest and continuing involvement in the program via invited lectures, seminars, general reading and social events. Commencing in Year 2, the research projects, each offered as separate courses, will be supervised by academic staff from the same or closely related discipline. Students in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. The final assessment, due by the end of the session, will be based on a written paper and an oral presentation.\nThe program is of three years duration and is awarded as a pass degree. There is provision for students who have completed the Bachelor of Technology (Aeronautical Engineering) to upgrade it to a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering by undertaking 12 months of additional study.\nThe BTech (Aero) (CDF) program is very similar to the first three years of the BE (Aero) (CDF) program. The BTech (Aero) (CDF) is primarily designed for RAAF Officer Cadets who intend to become aircrew and wish to enhance their understanding of the operation and performance of aircraft. The program extends the educational principles embodied in the BTech to a higher level of the degree. In the program, students will be exposed in the first year to research methods in Engineering and will be offered significant extensions to the ideas and analysis performed in the standard degree program. This will allow them to undertake research projects, at the appropriate level, in their later years, thereby, more fully integrating research into the standard undergraduate degree. The individual projects undertaken in close association with academic staff on research topics of mutual interest underpin the program and give the students the ability to develop their full potential.",

        "overview": "Engineering degrees offered by UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to future leaders in the Australian Defence Force and to civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to research, the profession, industry and the community.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering is of four years duration and the degree may be awarded at Honours Class I, Honours Class II, Division I or Honours Class II, Division II.\nThese Honours levels will be displayed on the final testamur. Candidates who do not achieve Honours Class I or II will receive a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering with no honours level displayed.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering program at UNSW Canberra has been granted full accreditation by Engineers Australia and has been recognised by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering is built on a foundation of mathematics, computing, and physical science. An introduction to electrical engineering is provided through two courses in the first year, with progressively larger components in second and third year. The remaining early year courses consist of programming, mathematics, and physics: these are essential foundations for the later year EE courses.\nThe final year is devoted exclusively to electrical engineering courses. Each year of the program comprises a number of discipline-based courses and courses taught by other discipline areas. Most courses in the first three years of the program are common for all electrical engineering students. In the fourth year, students have the option to select specialty topics in areas such as communications, surveillance and radar, computer engineering and guided weapons electronics.\nElectrical Engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering. It has its origin in the turning to the practical use of the discoveries of Faraday, Ampere, Maxwell and a number of other eminent 19th century physicists. It has remained the most strongly science-oriented branch of engineering and is closely related to computer science. At first, it had its major impact by providing the means for the generation, distribution and utilisation of electric power. While this remains an important sub-area of the whole discipline, the last few decades particularly have seen a rapid and extensive diversification into the fields of computers and control as well as electronics and communications, and beyond them into such areas as biology, medicine and space technology. It is now true to say that there are very few areas of civilised activity that have remained untouched by the ideas and products of modern electrical engineering. The rapid growth in networked devices is driven almost entirely by electrical engineering.\nElectrical engineers work at the intersection of electronics, mathematics, programming, control, and networking, and are thus ideally suited for the problems of the coming decades.",

        "overview": "Engineering degrees offered by UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to the future leaders of the Australian Defence Force and to civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to the engineering profession, industry and the community.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Aeronautical Engineering is of four years duration and the degree may be awarded at Honours Class I, Honours Class II, Division I or Honours Class II, Division II.\nThese Honours levels will be displayed on the final testamur.\nCandidates who do not achieve Honours Class 1 or 2 will receive a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Aeronautical Engineering with no honours level displayed.\nThe engineering programs at UNSW Canberra have been granted full accreditation by Engineers Australia.\nAeronautical engineering is the study of the design, development, manufacture, maintenance and control of machines or vehicles operating in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere or in outer space.\nThe design of a flight vehicle is quite complex and demands a knowledge of many engineering disciplines such as aerodynamics, propulsion systems, structural design, materials, avionics, and stability and control systems. Maintaining and operating a flight vehicle requires an understanding of materials, reliability and maintenance, structural analysis for necessary repairs, together with knowledge of the disciplines within the design process.\nExcept for Electrical Engineering and those in the Chief of Defence Force Honours Program first-year engineering and technology students enrol in a common program taking foundation science and engineering courses. In second and increasingly in third and fourth years the programs diverge into their specialities although there are some courses that span across programs in all years. A key element in all years is the design stream which emphasises complex problem-solving. Other streams such as aerodynamics, stability, control, thermofluids, structures, mechanics, materials and management often incorporate project-based learning informed by academic research and industrial practice. Electives and a final year thesis enable students to pursue particular interests both within and outside the specialist discipline.\nAt the end of the program, students are expected to meet the graduate attributes of the University and Stage 1 Competencies of Engineers Australia, ready to practise in their chosen profession and with the ingenuity and resourcefulness to meet rapid technological change.",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 192 UOC when taken as a standalone program.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Aeronautical Engineering degrees require a prescribed program structure as determined by the engineering program chosen. Each year of the program comprises a number of School-based courses (identified by the prefix ZEIT) and courses taught by other Schools within UNSW Canberra.\nCompletion of each year, thereby allowing progression to the next year, is normally achieved by satisfactory progress in each of the courses given in that year. At the discretion of the Head of School, students may be allowed to concurrently enrol in courses from more than one year of the program.\n1. Core Courses - 162 UOC 2. Technical Elective Courses - 18 UOC 3. General Education Courses - 12 UOC",

        "overview": "Background\n\n\nCivil Engineering takes its name from the division of engineering in the Middle Ages between military and civilian works. The profession of Civil Engineering was recognized by the formation of the Institution of Civil Engineers (UK) in 1825. In the 19th Century, the broadening scope of engineering led to the division of civilian engineering into civil, mechanical and electrical, with further specializations (aeronautical, chemical, industrial, materials, electronic etc.) having developed in the 20th Century.\n\nAfter contracting its sphere of interest over a long period of time, Civil Engineering is now broadening its scope with the recognition of the wider implications of its effects on modern society. Attention is given both to the interaction between civil engineering and other disciplines and to the effect of Civil Engineering works on the environment. Present day civil engineering has maintained strong commonality with military engineering - the design and construction of facilities such as roads, bridges, airfields, buildings, water supply and waste treatment facilities, structures of all types, and the associated planning and management of projects.\n\n\nProgram Description\n\n\nEngineering degrees offered by UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to the future leaders of the Australian Defence Force and civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to the engineering profession, industry and the community.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering program is of four years duration and the degree may be awarded at Honours Class I, Honours Class II, Division I or Honours Class II, Division II. These honours levels will be displayed on the final testamur. Candidates who do not achieve Honours Class I or II will receive a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering with no honours level displayed.\n\nThe engineering programs at UNSW Canberra have been granted full accreditation by Engineers Australia.\n\nIn the first year, students will complete most fundamental science, mathematics and computing courses. During the second and third years, students will be required to complete all core civil engineering courses in areas of structures, construction materials, geotechnics, transportation, hydraulics and environmental engineering. In the final year, all students will complete both final year thesis and integrated design project to enhance their skills in solving complex civil engineering problems. Furthermore, all students will also take two technical electives which will further enhance their technical knowledge in specific areas of civil engineering.",

        "overview": "All engineering degrees within UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to the future leaders of the Australian Defence Force and civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to the engineering profession, industry and the community.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering is of four years duration, and the degree may be awarded at Honours Class I, Honours Class II, Division I or Honours Class II, Division II.\nThese honours levels will be displayed on the final testamur.\nCandidates who do not achieve Honours Class 1 or 2 will receive a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering with no honours level displayed.\n\nMechanical Engineering is the branch of engineering that is concerned with machines and the production of power, and particularly with forces and motion. It became a separate branch of engineering in the early 1800s, when steam power began to be used in manufacture and transportation.\n\nOne can identify four functions that are common to all branches of mechanical engineering.\n\nThe first is the understanding of and dealing with the bases of mechanical science. These include dynamics, concerning the relationship between forces and motion, such as vibration; automatic control: thermodynamics, dealing with the relations among the various forms of heat, energy, and power; fluid flow; heat transfer; lubrication; and properties of materials.\n\nSecond is the sequence of research, design, and development. This function attempts to bring about the changes necessary to meet present and future needs. Such work requires not only a clear understanding of mechanical science and an ability to analyse a complex system into its basic factors, but also the originality to synthesise and invent.\n\nThird is production of products and power, which embraces planning, operation and maintenance. The goal is to produce the maximum value with the minimum investment and cost while maintaining or enhancing longer term viability of the enterprise or the institution.\n\nFourth is the co-ordinating function of the mechanical engineer, including management, consulting and, in some cases, marketing.\n\nIn all of these functions there is a long continuing trend towards the use of scientific instead of traditional or intuitive methods. Operations research, value engineering and reliability centred maintenance are typical titles of such new rationalised approaches. Creativity, however, cannot be rationalised. The ability to take the important and unexpected step that opens up new solutions remains in mechanical engineering, as elsewhere, largely a personal and spontaneous characteristic.\n\n(The above description was adapted from the Encyclopedia Britannica).\n\nExcept for Electrical Engineering and those in the Chief of Defence Force Honours Program first-year engineering and technology students enrol in a common program taking foundation science and engineering courses. In second and increasingly in third and fourth years the programs diverge into their specialities although there are some courses that span across programs in all years. A key element in all years is the design stream which emphasises complex problem solving. Other streams such as stability, control, thermofluid dynamics, structures, mechanics, materials and management often incorporate project based learning informed by academic research and industrial practice. Electives and a final year thesis enable students to pursue particular interests both within and outside the specialist discipline.\n\nAt the end of the program students are expected to meet the graduate attributes of the University and Stage 1 Competencies of Engineers Australia, ready to practice in their chosen profession and with the ingenuity and resourcefulness to meet rapid technological change.",

        "overview": "The Chief of Defence Force Honours Program in Engineering offers the opportunity for students entering UNSW Canberra with a high Entrance Rank, and who maintain a high level of performance in their studies, to undertake research in a range of disciplines that will develop their critical thinking and independent research skills beyond that available in the standard Engineering program.\nCommencing in Year 2, the research projects, each offered as separate courses, will be supervised by academic staff from the same or closely related discipline. Students in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. Final assessment, due by the end of semester, will be based on a written paper and an oral presentation.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Electrical Engineering is built on a foundation of mathematics, computing science and physical science. The program is specifically designed for undergraduate students who have shown academic excellence in their studies and it incorporates significant elements of training in research methods at all years of the program. A small component of electrical engineering is introduced in the first year, with progressively larger components in second and third year. The final year is almost exclusively devoted to electrical engineering courses. Each year of the program comprises a number of discipline-based courses, courses taught by other discipline areas and problem-based learning courses.\nElectrical Engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering. It has its origin in the turning to practical use of the discoveries of Faraday, Ampere, Maxwell and a number of other eminent 19th century physicists. It has remained the most strongly science-oriented branch of engineering. At first it had its major impact by providing the means for the generation, distribution and utilisation of electric power. However, while this remains an important sub-area of the whole discipline, the last few decades particularly have seen a rapid and extensive diversification into the fields of computers and control as well as electronics and communications, and beyond them into such areas as biology, medicine and space technology. It is now true to say that there are very few areas of civilised activity that have remained untouched by the ideas and products of modern electrical engineering. The absorption of recent scientific development has been very rapid and has demanded a fully developed scientific outlook on the part of electrical engineers for a proper understanding of the problems involved. Many devices, scarcely more than laboratory prototypes a decade ago, are now in widespread use as fully engineered hardware.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Electrical Engineering has program objectives and learning outcomes in common with the standard Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering program. The program extends the educational principles embodied in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering) to a higher level of the degree. In the program, students will be exposed in first year to research methods in Engineering and will be offered significant extensions to the ideas and analysis performed in the standard degree program. This will allow them to undertake research projects, at the appropriate level, in their later years, thereby, more fully integrating research into the standard coursework undergraduate degree. The individual projects undertaken in close association with academic staff on research topics of mutual interest underpin the program and give the students the ability to develop their full potential.",

        "overview": "All engineering degrees within UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to the future leaders of the Australian Defence Force and civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to the engineering profession, industry and the community.\nNaval Architecture is concerned with the design, building and utilisation of all types of ships and marine vehicles.\nShips and marine vehicles can be classified into military vessels which include frigates, destroyers, patrol vessels, aircraft carriers, mine hunters and submarines; trading vessels which include cargo and container ships; and commercial vessels which include fishing boats, tugs, dredges, pilot boats, lighthouse supply craft, servicing vessels for oil rigs, crew transfer, passenger and vehicle ferries, floating cranes, and other specialised ships and pleasure craft. These three categories of marine vehicles can be in the form of a monohull (the usual single-hull ship or boat), a multihull catamaran or trimaran (a twin or triple hull vessel), or dynamically supported craft such as hovercraft (an air-cushion vehicle) or hydrofoil (a vessel that is lifted out of the water by submerged wings).\nNaval architects must be conversant with a wide variety of skills, including most forms of engineering and marine architecture. A ship must be a completely self-sufficient vehicle containing several systems and able to withstand the loads from the sea.\nNaval architecture firms and consultants are significant employers of naval architects. Naval architects working in the field of high-speed ferries have been particularly successful. Australia holds the leading position in the research and development of passenger and cargo multihulls.\nThe Commonwealth Department of Defence White Paper (2016) reaffirmed the Government s commitment to a strong, internationally competitive and sustainable Australian naval shipbuilding industry which will rely heavily on naval architects. The Commonwealth s Naval Shipbuilding Plan (2017) identified naval architects as key enablers in the Australian naval shipbuilding workforce. Employment of naval architects within the defence sector occurs within the Department of Defence and the RAN.\nIn addition, federal and state government departments and statutory authorities such as AMSA and state transport departments employ naval architects, as do international classification societies such as Lloyd s Register, DNV and Bureau Veritas.\nGraduates of the program are expected to meet UNSW Graduate Capabilities embodied in the Program Learning Outcomes and Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies.",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 192 UOC when taken as a standalone program.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Naval Architecture degree requires a prescribed program structure. Each year of the program comprises School-based courses (identified by the prefix ZEIT) and courses taught by other Schools within UNSW Canberra.\nCompletion of each year, thereby allowing progression to the next year, is normally achieved by satisfactory progress in each of the courses given in that year. At the discretion of the Head of School, students may be allowed to concurrently enrol in courses from more than one year of the program.",

        "overview": "All engineering degrees within UNSW Canberra aim to provide outstanding engineering education to the future leaders of the Australian Defence Force and civilian students to pursue excellence through contributions to the engineering profession, industry and the community.\nThe Chief of Defence Force Honours Program in Engineering offers the opportunity for students entering UNSW Canberra with a high Entrance Rank, and who maintain a high level of performance in their studies, to undertake research in a range of disciplines that will develop their critical thinking and independent research skills beyond that available in the standard Engineering program.\nIn Year 1 of the program, students will be engaged with cohort activities so as to develop and maintain their interest and continuing involvement in the program via invited lectures, seminars, general reading and social events.\nCommencing in Year 2, the research projects, each offered as separate courses, will be supervised by academic staff from the same or closely related discipline. Students in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. Final assessment, due by the end of semester, will be based on a written paper and an oral presentation.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Naval Architecture program has objectives and learning outcomes in common with the standard Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Naval Architecture program.\nThe program extends the educational principles embodied in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Naval Architecture to a higher level of the degree. In the program, students will be exposed to research methods in Engineering and will be offered significant extensions to the ideas and analysis performed in the standard degree program. This will allow them to undertake research projects, at the appropriate level, in their later years, thereby, more fully integrating research into the standard undergraduate degree. The individual projects undertaken in close association with academic staff on research topics of mutual interest underpin the program and give the students the ability to develop their full potential.\nNaval Architecture is concerned with the design, building and utilisation of all types of ships and marine vehicles.\nShips and marine vehicles can be classified into military vessels which include frigates, destroyers, patrol vessels, aircraft carriers, mine hunters and submarines; trading vessels which include cargo and container ships; and commercial vessels which include fishing boats, tugs, dredges, pilot boats, lighthouse supply craft, servicing vessels for oil rigs, crew transfer, passenger and vehicle ferries, floating cranes, and other specialised ships and pleasure craft. These three categories of marine vehicles can be in the form of a monohull (the usual single-hull ship or boat), a multihull catamaran or trimaran (a twin or triple hull vessel), or dynamically supported craft such as hovercraft (an air-cushion vehicle) or hydrofoil (a vessel that is lifted out of the water by submerged wings).\nNaval architects must be conversant with a wide variety of skills, including most forms of engineering and marine architecture. A ship must be a completely self-sufficient vehicle containing several systems and able to withstand the loads from the sea.\nGraduates of the program are expected to meet UNSW Graduate Capabilities embodied in the Program Learning Outcomes and Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies.",
        "structure_summary": "Students must complete 192 UOC when taken as a standalone program.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Naval Architecture degree requires a prescribed program structure. Each year of the program comprises School-based courses (identified by the prefix ZEIT) and courses taught by other Schools within UNSW Canberra.\nCompletion of each year, thereby allowing progression to the next year, is normally achieved by satisfactory progress in each of the courses given in that year. At the discretion of the Head of School, students may be allowed to concurrently enrol in courses from more than one year of the program.",

Honours is a means for connecting undergraduate study with supervised independent research by consolidating and extending work completed in the undergraduate program and providing an academic foundation for students continuing on to a Masters by research or a PhD.\n\nAs part of the honours program students will be expected to complete a significant independent research project and may be expected to complete coursework. As the Faculty has a diverse range of disciplines the exact proportion of research-based work and coursework may differ by School. Students should refer to the plan pages in this Handbook for details of the different Honours programs.\n\nIn addition to conducting research and coursework students will generally also be expected to undertake Occupational Health &amp; Safety (OH&amp;S) training, attend and present seminars, write a literature review, and write a thesis.",

If you commenced in a prior year please refer to the Online Handbook in the year you started your Law degree or contact the Faculty of Law for advice.\n\nThis program combines the professional LLB program with Bachelor of Medicinal Chemistry (Honours). Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) is an exciting, rapidly-expanding area within the broad discipline of Chemistry that has seen enormous growth recently both within Australia and globally. It includes the development of new pharmaceutical agents, from Concept to Clinic. Many different stages are involved; from the design and synthesis of novel drug candidates, to their biochemical effects, testing regimes and regulatory and ethical considerations. The Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) program had been designed to ensure that graduates will have a strong background in contemporary biology, biochemistry and pharmacology, based upon a solid foundation of essential chemistry. Combining this with a Bachelor of Laws also equips students with an understanding of the law, important in this industry, and provides graduates with a degree that is recognized as satisfying the academic requirements for admission as a legal practitioner in NSW.\n\nDuration\nThe program is a six and a half year full-time combined program leading to the award of the two degrees of Bachelor of Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) and Bachelor of Laws.",

        "overview": "This Handbook is for commencing students. If you commenced in a prior year please refer to the Online Handbook in the year you started your Law degree or contact the Faculty of Law and Justice for advice.\nThis program provides students with an opportunity to obtain two degrees of professional importance to the public sector, criminal justice, community service, business and law practice. Career opportunities include criminal justice agencies such as the Attorney-General&#39;s department, Police, Prisons; Customs; ASIO; Magistrates, District and Supreme Courts; Australian Bureau of Statistics; and practising as a criminal law barrister. In addition, graduates may also undertake analytical and research work in a wide range of areas from aspects of law such as sentencing and punishment to the social causes of a range of crimes from domestic violence to terrorism.\nThe Bachelor of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice (BCCJ) is an innovative and interdisciplinary field of study with a real world focus designed to explore your interests in crime, deviance, social control and the legal system. Contemporary criminological scholars investigate a broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, policing, state crime, alternative justice systems, criminalisation and regulation. Key concerns include the nature of crime, how crime is defined and measured, why people commit crime and how societies might respond. Criminologists tackle &#39;real world&#39; social problems including victimisation, juvenile justice, drug-related harm, community safety, indigenous justice, organised crime and corrections. Criminology is shaped by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, and other interdisciplinary fields including history, politics, economics, architecture, and cultural studies. The UNSW BCCJ also provides you with the skills of applied social research and policy analysis.",

The three-year Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions has been developed to train scientists to meet the current, and future, strong demand for Data Scientists and Data Analysts. The combination with Law creates an opportunity for graduates to gain skills in both domains, which is increasingly important as data science and data analysis plays a growing role in legal practice and the legal system more broadly.",

As well as a professional qualification, it will add further intellectual dimensions to the study of PPE.\nBPPE provides graduates with a uniquely powerful combination of intellectual tools with which to understand and act on the world. PPE graduates globally are recognised leaders in all aspects of public life, including the highest reaches of government, political parties and lobby groups, the public service, NGOs, and social activist organisations. It also equips students for careers in consultancy work and strategic advising to major corporations. PPE graduates are also well known as public commentators on contemporary issues. The PPE will help you bring the perspectives of three crucial intellectual disciplines to pressing contemporary national and global issues such as justice, inequality and climate change. As well as combining a carefully chosen combination of existing courses from the Politics and International Relations, Philosophy, and Economics streams, the program will include courses specifically designed to enable you to explore the synergies and tensions between them and assess their relevance to meeting humanity&#39;s most difficult challenges.\nDuration/Award\nThe program is a six year full-time combined program leading to the award of the two degrees of Bachelor of Politics, Philosophy and Economics and Bachelor of Laws (BPPE LLB).",

Credit will be granted towards the Bachelor of Commerce for each of the eight courses achieved at a specified level, which are all equivalent to First-Year UNSW courses. After successful completion of all nine courses, students will be awarded a Diploma of Business.\n\nNote: Economics and Information Systems areas of study/streams are currently not available.\n\nIn this Diploma program students will be able to experience a university environment and university life, while being supported to acquire all of the knowledge and skills needed for successful transition to undergraduate studies at UNSW. The courses in this program are equivalent in content and outcomes to First-Year UNSW courses but the delivery pace is slower and the face-to-face contact hours are greater. The course structure allows students to get accustomed to University learning styles - in Lectures, Tutorials and Problem-Solving Workshops - while receiving additional support, as required, for the duration of the diploma program.\nIt is assumed that students have a certain level of knowledge in advanced mathematics in order to cope well with the mathematical or statistical component of a Business Diploma.

After successful completion of all eight courses, you will be awarded a Diploma in Architecture.\nIn this Diploma Program you will be able to experience a university environment and university life, while being supported to acquire all of the knowledge and skills needed for successful transition to undergraduate studies at UNSW. The courses in this program are equivalent in content and outcomes to First-Year UNSW courses but the delivery pace is slower. This means that the term is longer (12 weeks) and the number of contact hours is greater, which enables you more opportunities for consultations, practice and revision. The course structure allows you to get accustomed to University learning styles - in live Lectures, or self-paced Lecture recordings, Studios and Problem-Solving Workshops - while receiving additional support, as required, for the duration of the diploma program.",
