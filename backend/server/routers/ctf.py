Implementation for the 2023 CTF.


Scenario:
    In the whimsical world of the CTF (Capture The Flag), an extraordinary
    challenge awaits our protagonist, Ollie the Otter. Ollie, a brilliant otter
    with a passion for education, has embarked on an academic journey like no
    other. But there's a twist â€“ Ollie's unique otter nature has led to some
    special conditions on his degree planning adventure.

    Ollie's task is to navigate through a degree planner system called
    "Circles," specially designed to accommodate his otter-specific
    requirements. In this intriguing scenario, you must help Ollie, the otter
    scholar, chart his academic path using Circles.

    Ollie is planning his 3 year Computer Science (3778) degree starting in 2024
    and wants to take a Computer Science major and Mathematics minor. Help him set
    up his degree in the degree wizard!

    When you are done, press the `Validate CTF` button on the term planner page
    to recieve your flags.

# Stage 1. The Otter's Academic Odyssey: Charting Uncharted Waters
    Being the pioneer Otter in academia, Ollie faces some unique conditions
    that must be fulfilled for him to successfully navigate his degree. Let's
    tackle parts 0-3 to obtain the first flag.

# Stage 2. The Kafka Quandary: Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The
# Handbook
    Ollie encounters additional hurdles due to university policies, with
    challenges 4 through 7 directly related to these policy-driven obstacles.
    Join Ollie in overcoming these challenges and guiding him through this
    academic maze

# Stage 3: (HARD) Numbers, Notions, and the Cult of Calculus: An O-Week Odyssey
    During Orientation Week (O-week), Ollie had a chance encounter with a group
    of math students. Little did he know that this encounter would lead to him
    being initiated into a number-centric cult. Over time, Ollie developed
    superstitions about certain numbers, and the ultimate challenges he faces
    revolve around aligning his degree plan with his newfound beliefs. With the
    last challenges, Ollie on his quest to complete his degree while also
    seeking the approval of the enigmatic number cult
