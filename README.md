# Circles

Tired of using a poorly laid out spreadsheet to cobble together a plan to follow for the next 3-8 years of your life? Have no fear, Circles is here!

Circles is a UNSW degree planner where you can explore and validate your degree structure.

You can find a live build of Circles at [https://circles.devsoc.app](https://circles.devsoc.app/).

## Features

![Features Help Image](./frontend/src/assets/infographic.png)

NOTE: we currently only support a selection of degrees - but we will add more!

- Adaptive course selector:
  - Allows you to explore your currently unlocked courses
  - Shows all the courses relevant to your degree
  - Automatically checks if you meet the requirement to take a course

- Term planner:
  - An intuitive drag and drop interface
  - Validates your progression to make sure you've met the requirements for future courses
  - Allows you to generate a saveable and sharable image of your plan

- Progression checker: (NEW PAGE!)
  - Lets you understand which requirements you have met and which you still need to complete
  - Shows you what courses you can do to complete your degree

## Future Plans

This project is rapidly expanding and our roadmap includes features such as:

- Graphical view:
  - A graphical model of your degree plan, to show you a beautiful dependency tree of courses relevant to your degree
  - Will adapt to your degree structure
